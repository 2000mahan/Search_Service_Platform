WASHINGTON \u2014 Fifty years to the day after the last Apollo moon mission touched down on the lunar surface, NASA\u2019s plans to return to the moon took a major step forward with the successful splashdown of the Orion spacecraft to end the Artemis 1 mission. The Orion spacecraft splashed down off the coast of Baja California at 12:40 p.m. Eastern Dec. 11, ending the 25.5-day Artemis 1 uncrewed test flight. The splashdown took place near recovery forces led by the USS Portland, which will haul the capsule onto the ship to transport back to the port of San Diego, California. \u201cThis has been an extraordinarily successful mission,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a briefing about three hours after splashdown. \u201cIt is the beginning of the new beginning, and that is to explore the heavens.\u201d After the European Service Module separated at 12:00 p.m. Eastern, the Orion crew capsule performed a \u201cskip\u201d reentry, descending first to an altitude of about 60 kilometers, then ascending to about 90 kilometers before completing the rest of descent. That maneuver is designed to reduce g-forces on the spacecraft and allows more flexibility in selecting a landing site. Successfully completing reentry at lunar return velocities of up to 40,000 kilometers per hour was the top objective of the Artemis 1 mission, since there was no other way to test the spacecraft\u2019s thermal protection system. \u201cThere is no arcjet or aerothermal facility here on Earth of replicating hypersonic reentry with a heat shield of this size,\u201d said Mike Sarafin, NASA Artemis 1 mission manager, at a Dec. 8 briefing. At the post-splashdown briefing, Sarafin and Howard Hu, NASA Orion program manager, said they were only starting to review data collected during the reentry, but what they had reviewed so far showed that the Orion thermal protection system met expectations. \u201cI would say we\u2019re very happy with what we\u2019ve seen so far on the heat shield,\u201d Hu said. \u201cInitial indications are very favorable, but there\u2019s more ahead of us in terms of exactly understanding what the reentry flight test told us,\u201d Sarafin said. Sarafin said there was no evidence of any issues from the time of service module separation through splashdown, although they still needed to review data collected during two communications blackouts caused by the plasma from reentry, as expected. The splashdown took place within 3.9 kilometers of the target, according to Hu. The mission had a requirement of splashing down within 10 kilometers. After splashdown, Sarafin said crews were not able to recover the parachutes or the door to the forward bay on the capsule where they were stored before they sank into the ocean, but said project officials knew that was a possibility. \u201cThe fact that the parachute deployment was all nominal really makes the retrieval of the parachutes kind of a moot point,\u201d he added. After splashdown, NASA planned to leave the capsule in the water and powered on for two hours to conduct a \u201csoakback\u201d test to see how the capsule handled the heat from reentry. Teams will then use boats to tow the capsule into the well deck of the USS Portland, where it will be secured in a cradle and the deck drained before heading to San Diego. The splashdown concluded a long-delayed mission that started with a launch on the first flight of the Space Launch System Nov. 16 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This was the second time the Orion capsule flew in space, after the brief Exploration Flight Test 1 orbital mission in December 2014, but the first to feature the full Orion spacecraft that included the European Service Module. Orion  flew by the moon Nov. 21 , passing about 130 kilometers above the surface as it performed a maneuver to send the spacecraft towards a distant retrograde orbit around the moon.  Orion entered that orbit Nov. 25 ,  departing Dec. 1  and  performing another lunar flyby and maneuver Dec. 5  that put the spacecraft on course back to Earth. The splashdown took place 50 years to the day after Apollo 17\u2019s Lunar Module touched down in the Taurus-Littrow region of the moon on the sixth and final Apollo lunar landing mission. No humans have been beyond low Earth orbit since the conclusion of that mission. Sarafin, at the Dec. 8 briefing, noted Artemis 1 was the 65th mission supporting human spaceflight he had been involved with. \u201cI love flight testing,\u201d he said when asked to compare Artemis 1 with Apollo 17. \u201cThe first time you do anything is harder than a repeat.\u201d \u201cFirsts are harder, because you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as you get to more and more challenging missions, like Apollo 17, that becomes a harder question to answer.\u201d The first crewed Orion mission, Artemis 2, is projected to take place no earlier than late 2024. It will take four astronauts, including one from the Canadian Space Agency, on a flight around the moon and back. Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, said at the post-splashdown briefing that NASA still planned to conduct Artemis 2 about two years after Artemis 1, in part because of avonics components from the Artemis 1 Orion that will be refurbished and reused on the Artemis 2 Orion.. \u201cWe obviously want to try and do it quicker,\u201d he said, by applying lessons learned from Artemis 1. Regarding a crew for the mission, Vanessa Wyche, director of the Johnson Space Center, said NASA wanted to wait until it was clear Artemis 1 was a success before naming a crew. \u201cIf all is still go and everything looks good, then our plan is to name the crew in early 2023.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/orion-splashes-down-to-end-artemis-1/"}, "1": {"title": "Polaris Dawn crewed mission could suffer additional delays", "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 A billionaire-backed private astronaut mission on a SpaceX Crew Dragon has slipped from late this year to March 2023 and could be further delayed, in part for issues beyond its control. The Polaris Program,  an initiative announced in February by Shift4 founder Jared Isaacman,  originally planned its first Crew Dragon mission, Polaris Dawn, to fly in the fourth quarter of this year. The four-person crew, which includes Isaacman, will perform the first spacewalk from a Crew Dragon spacecraft and fly to a higher altitude than previous crewed orbital spaceflights. As recently as July,  that mission was still scheduled to fly this year, with a projected launch in December . By September, though, the launch had quietly slipped to no earlier than March 2023, a date the Polaris Program confirmed Oct. 24 in an announcement of biomedical experiments it plans to perform on the five-day flight. In a Oct. 24 statement to SpaceNews, Polaris spokesperson Sarah Grover said that the program reevaluated the December launch date in September based on the readiness of hardware, software and training for the mission, as well as the overall manifest of SpaceX missions. That led the program to move the launch to no earlier than March 1. That date, too, is subject to change. \u201cIn addition to the development driven schedule risk, moving into the winter brings us into a busy period and our date could be directly impacted by ISS missions, which carry their own uncertainty,\u201d she said. While Polaris Dawn is not going to the International Space Station, other SpaceX crew and cargo missions would launch from the same pad at Launch Complex 39A. That includes NASA\u2019s Crew-6 mission to the ISS, tentatively scheduled for as soon as February 2023. Another factor is the use of LC-39A for Falcon Heavy launches. \u201cThere is also uncertainty from the Falcon side as there are potential Falcon Heavy launches with government priority ratings in the mix,\u201d she said. Those are likely the USSF-67 and USSF-52 missions for the U.S. Space Force, currently scheduled for early 2023 after extended delays. She said the next evaluation point for Polaris Dawn is in November. \u201cIn the meantime we\u2019ll continue to burn down development items and gain certainty in our manifest.\u201d That includes training for Isaacman and the other members of the crew: Scott Poteet, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon. That training features preparations for a spacewalk, something not done on Crew Dragon or any other commercial mission to date, although the program has not disclosed details about it. \u201cWe do take this very seriously,\u201d Isaacman said of training in an Oct. 3 Washington Post webinar, with eight to nine months planned versus six months for Inspiration4. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it right, because if we do get it wrong, this timeline gets reset in a big way.\u201d A second Polaris Program flight, also on a Crew Dragon, could go to the Hubble Space Telescope to reboost or service it,  pending the outcome of a study NASA announced it was undertaking with SpaceX Sept. 29 . The third mission would be the first crewed flight of SpaceX\u2019s Starship vehicle. Neither Polaris nor SpaceX have announced dates for those projected missions.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/polaris-dawn-crewed-mission-could-suffer-additional-delays/"}, "2": {"title": "DART on track for asteroid collision", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A NASA spacecraft is on course to deliberately collide with a small asteroid Sept. 26 to test how that technique could be used to deflect a potentially hazardous asteroid. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft,  launched last November , is on a trajectory to collide with Dimorphos, a small asteroid orbiting the larger near Earth asteroid Didymos, at 7:14 p.m. Eastern Sept. 26. The collision will change slightly the orbit of Dimorphos, allowing scientists to measure how effective such a collision, or \u201ckinetic impact,\u201d could be to change the trajectory of any future asteroids that pose a hazard to the Earth. At a Sept. 22 briefing, project officials said the spacecraft was operating well as it approached the asteroids. \u201cThe team is ready, the ground systems are ready and the spacecraft is healthy and on track for an impact on Monday,\u201d said Edward Reynolds, DART project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, which operates the mission. Targeting Dimorphos, an object about 160 meters across, will be a challenge. The object won\u2019t be resolved by DART\u2019s camera, DRACO, until about an hour before impact. The spacecraft will use software called SMART Nav to lock on to Dimorphos and adjust its trajectory to stay centered on it. That work will be done autonomously by the spacecraft, although controllers will have the ability to send commands until the final minutes if needed. \u201cWe have 21 contingencies that we planned for and are ready to execute,\u201d said Elena Adams, DART mission systems engineer at APL. Those contingencies include adjusting camera settings if Dimorphos is too dim and telling the spacecraft to change objects it is targeting. Another factor is that scientists don\u2019t know the shape of Dimorphos, which could range from something roughly spherical to highly elongated. \u201cThere are a lot of different possibilities of what it could be, and it won\u2019t really be until those last seconds and minutes, as we\u2019re honing in, that we\u2019re going to get a real sense of what it\u2019s made out of, what is its shape,\u201d said Betsy Congdon, DART mechanical lead engineer at APL, in a talk at the International Astronautical Congress in Paris Sept. 22. The mission is also prepared if DART misses Dimorphos. \u201cIf there is a miss, the first thing we have to do is figure out what happened,\u201d said Lindley Johnson, NASA planetary defense officer. \u201cThat will be the first thing: to safe the spacecraft, get all the information down from the spacecraft.\u201d Adams said the 21 contingencies the mission has prepared for includes missing Dimorphos. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start preserving all the data on board about why we missed,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll start preserving propellant and we\u2019ll start looking for an object to come back to.\u201d However, NASA is confident that DART will hit Dimorphos. \u201cThrough all the testing that we\u2019ve done,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI\u2019m highly confident that we\u2019re going to hit on Monday and that it will be a complete success.\u201d While the impact marks the end of DART the spacecraft, it is only the beginning of the next phase of the overall DART mission. A network of ground-based telescopes will observe the asteroids in the days and weeks after the impact to measure the change in period in the orbit of Dimorphos around Didymos. The Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope and Lucy spacecraft, approaching Earth for a gravity-assist flyby, will also observe the asteroids. \u201cDifferent parts of the investigation team have their own ideas about that and they\u2019re competing with each other,\u201d Tom Statler, DART program scientist at NASA, said of the time it would take to determine the new orbit of Dimorphos. \u201cI would be surprised if we had a firm measurement of the period change in less than a few days, and I would be really surprised if it took more than three weeks.\u201d There may also be images of the impact and aftermath taken by an Italian cubesat called LICIACube that hitched a ride with DART and was deployed earlier this month. LICIACube will pass about 55 kilometers from Dimorphos about three minutes after the impact, collecting images to return to Earth afterwards. Statler said the rate the cubesat can return images will depend on the spacecraft\u2019s status after the close approach and availability of time on the Deep Space Network. The cubesat, operated by the Italian space agency ASI, will attempt to first return images taken at times most likely to confirm an impact. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be expecting more than a couple of images per day, on average,\u201d he said. A successful impact will give NASA more insight into the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor approach to changing the orbit of potentially hazardous asteroids, although agency officials emphasized that Didymos, nor any other known asteroid, poses a near-term impact threat to the Earth. \u201cThis demonstration is extremely important to our future here on the Earth, and life on Earth,\u201d said Johnson.  There will be some tension in the control room in the final minutes. \u201cIn the last couple of minutes, we\u2019re all going to be standing up, waiting to see us hit an asteroid,\u201d said Adams. The DRACO camera will be returning images at a rate of one per second, with the last taken about 2.5 seconds before impact because of onboard processing, she said. At that point contact with DART will be lost. \u201cThe mood right now is one of nervous excitement,\u201d said Congdon, discussing dress rehearsals for the impact in mission control.  \u201cEveryone is confident and really excited about the next couple of days. During this mission dress rehearsal we even practiced cheering for the loss of signal.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/dart-on-track-for-asteroid-collision/"}, "3": {"title": "U.S. Space Command calls for investment in technologies for deep space missions", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, was at Cape Canaveral, Florida, earlier this week, hoping to see NASA\u2019s first Artemis launch. The launch  was scrubbed  but Shaw said he took advantage of the time there to chat with NASA leaders about future collaborations. \u201cWe had a lot of discussions,\u201d he said Aug. 31 in remarks to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \u201cDARPA Forward\u201d conference held in Fort Collins, Colorado.  Shaw said space security problems confronting the United States and allies can\u2019t be solved by the military alone, particularly as DoD looks to support operations beyond Earth orbit. \u201cAs NASA and Artemis go to the moon, one of the challenges that we will have as a nation is understanding that lunar environment,\u201d he said.  DoD today performs space traffic control to help satellites in orbit and the International Space Station avoid collisions with other satellites or with debris objects. \u201cWe think that we\u2019re probably going to need to partner with NASA in the future as we send astronauts into the lunar environment for long durations to do the same thing there,\u201d Shaw said. In cislunar space, \u201cit\u2019s not quite as crowded, but it\u2019s not empty of debris and objects.\u201d Tracking that vast region of space will be difficult due to the \u201ctyranny of volume,\u201d said Shaw. The area between the Earth and the moon is \u201ca lot of volume, and that\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us to miss things that are happening that we need to be aware of,\u201d he said. That includes natural hazards, debris and electromagnetic interference but also \u201cdeliberate threats.\u201d Shaw said new technologies will be needed to better understand the cislunar space environment, including space-based sensors and vehicles that can operate autonomously for long periods of time without resupply or commands from the ground.  He noted that DARPA has led the way in technological innovations with autonomous vehicles, mostly for operations on land, at sea or in the air. \u201cI would propose that in no domain will it be more important to have cutting-edge autonomy enabled by machine learning than in the space domain,\u201d said Shaw. Because of the distances, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to need platforms that don\u2019t need human operators or even machines necessarily back on Earth to tell them what\u2019s going on and how to behave,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need to do that autonomously, whether that\u2019s maintaining orbits, avoiding debris, avoiding threats, or finding the optimal ways to conduct their mission.\u201d As technology evolves, he said, \u201cwe have to find the right balance between human oversight and what we allow machines to do on their own \u2026 as we\u2019re operating more complex systems farther and farther away from the planet.\u201d Addressing the DARPA crowd, Shaw said, \u201cI urge you all, when you\u2019re thinking autonomous platforms, think not only the terrestrial domains, but think about space, how do we take that cutting-edge innovation and capability and apply it to missions that we\u2019re going to need to be able to do in the space domain?\u201d Propulsion, in-space refueling Other technologies that will be critical for deep space are propulsion and logistics support, Shaw said. He gave kudos to DARPA for its nuclear powered spacecraft project known as  DRACO , or Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations. Range and endurance are limited by current electric and chemical space propulsion systems, which Shaw called \u201cthe tyranny of the rocket equation.\u201d Right now, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything on the technological horizon that\u2019s going to be a big game changer on that,\u201d said Shaw, adding that programs like DRACO will bring incremental improvements in propulsion for long-dwell missions or missions that require quick maneuvers on short timelines. Logistics support is another major hurdle, he said. \u201cSince the dawn of the space age \u2026 all of our satellites and spacecraft we send to space have taken their propellant with them and they don\u2019t refuel.\u201d As the nation invests in new space platforms, said Shaw, \u201cwe need to develop with that a complementary logistics structure that allows us to refuel, to service and extend lifetime and extend capability.\u201d Military organizations that are planning satellite missions \u201chave to use the constraints on their propellant in their calculations. They have to consider the delta-v budget over the lifetime of a satellite when they think about their mission,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to take that out of the equation.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-space-command-calls-for-investment-in-technologies-for-deep-space-missions/"}, "4": {"title": "SpaceX requests permission for direct-to-smartphone service", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 SpaceX could provide \u201cfull and continuous\u201d direct-to-smartphone services across much of the globe with less than a third of the 7,500 Gen 2 Starlink satellites approved last week, the company said in a request to add the capability to the broadband constellation. SpaceX filed an application with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Dec. 6 to include a \u201cdirect-to-cellular\u201d hosted payload on around 2,000 Gen 2 satellites. The payload would enable these satellites to use spectrum from cellular partners to deliver \u201cvoice, messaging, and basic web browsing\u201d to standard phones beyond the reach of terrestrial networks, SpaceX senior regulatory engineer Kyle Wesson wrote in an accompanying letter to the FCC. \u201cAt full deployment, this hosted payload will enable SpaceX to provide full and continuous coverage of the Earth within +58\u00b0 to -58\u00b0 latitude by mid-2024,\u201d Wesson said. SpaceX has so far only announced a partnership to use spectrum from T-Mobile to provide a direct-to-smartphone service in the United States. In its application with the FCC, SpaceX said its direct-to-smartphone service would be able to connect to phones that communicate in the same 1.9 GHz band that T-Mobile uses. \u201cThe total number of satellites serving the United States and its territories simultaneously will typically be between 80 and 100,\u201d Wesson said. He outlined \u201ctheoretical peak speeds\u201d of up to 18.3 megabits per second (Mbps) downlink and 7.2 Mbps upload per beam when using a higher bandwidth channel. \u201cThe direct-to-cellular services will be available for residential, commercial, institutional, and governmental users in the entire contiguous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and some of the most remote corridors of Alaska,\u201d he told the FCC. SpaceX\u2019s application comes barely a week after the FCC granted it conditional approval to launch  only a quarter of its proposed 30,000 Gen 2 satellites , while deferring action on the rest. The new service could also connect remote Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Wesson said, building on \u201cSpaceX\u2019s  expansion into this mobile services arena  with its acquisition of [small satellite operator] Swarm Technologies\u201d last year. Swarm was co-founded by Sara Spangelo, who is now a SpaceX senior director of satellite engineering and is helping lead its direct-to-smartphone expansion. In November, Spangelo said SpaceX expected to secure three to five more direct-to-smartphone partnerships by early 2023 after being approached  by more than 50 telcos  worldwide.  She said SpaceX could launch initial services, starting with text messaging, as early as 2024. Direct-to-smartphone services Apple launched  via Globalstar satellites in November  are currently limited to emergency SOS messaging for iPhone 14 handsets in the United States and Canada. Other established companies and startups also have their own plans to deploy  a variety of satellite services  directly to standard smartphones. And while SpaceX is searching for more terrestrial spectrum partners, the company has asked the FCC for more spectrum that could be used for a mobile Starlink satellite service \u2014 including in the 1.6GHz and 2.4GHz spectrum bands used by Globalstar and the 2GHz band  assigned to satellite broadcaster Dish Network .

Europe\u2019s Thales Alenia Space said July 19 it had secured 2.3 million euros ($2.4 million) in ESA funding to advance its design of a satellite capable of operating in orbit below 300 kilometers.  The funding includes an 800,000 euro study contract for a demonstrator that would use electrical propulsion to compensate for air drag at these low altitudes, which promise sharper resolutions for Earth observation applications. The company secured the funds in partnership with QinetiQ, a British aerospace company planning to provide altitude and orbit control systems (AOCS), among other capabilities for the platform. Their one-year study, led by Thales Alenia Space\u2019s U.K. subsidiary and QinetiQ\u2019s space division in Belgium, includes the selection of payloads for a future Skimsat mission. Nigel Towers, head of sales strategy and marketing for Thales Alenia Space in the U.K., did not give a potential launch date for Skimsat, but said the study contract enables the companies to define the mission and platform concept.

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 After years of delays, NASA\u2019s Space Launch System lifted off for the first time Nov. 16, sending an uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a shakedown cruise around the moon. The SLS lifted off from Launch Complex 39B here at 1:47 a.m. Eastern. The rocket\u2019s upper stage, called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), separated from the core stage eight and a half minutes after liftoff. The Orion spacecraft separated from the ICPS nearly two hours after liftoff, after the stage completed a translunar injection burn. \u201cWe have a priority-one mission in play right now,\u201d said Mike Sarafin, NASA Artemis 1 mission manager, at a post-launch briefing. He was referring to the mission\u2019s top priority to have the Orion capsule reenter at lunar velocities at the end of the mission, something enabled by the successful launch. \u201cWe had the rocket do its job and deliver the spacecraft to the point of translunar injection.\u201d The Orion spacecraft was \u201cperforming exactly as we intended,\u201d he said, with the exception of a few \u201cfunnies\u201d or minor issues. That included a glitch with a spacecraft star tracker and microswitches in a solar array that did not immediately indicate it latched into place as expected when the array deployed, but later did so. The launch took place more than 40 minutes into a two-hour window after overcoming two issues during the countdown. A little more than three hours before the opening of the launch window, NASA reported a leak in a valve in ground equipment used to replenish the core stage\u2019s liquid hydrogen tank. The launch director dispatched a small \u201cred crew\u201d to the pad to tighten bolts in the valve, fixing the leak. \u201cOur most likely case here was that we just had some loose nuts on those valves,\u201d said Mike Bolger, Exploration Ground Systems Program manager, at a post-launch briefing. \u201cWe sent the team out and they did a terrific job, and we got the issue resolved.\u201d \u201cIt was a low moment when we first saw the leak,\u201d he added, bringing up hydrogen leaks in past launch attempts, \u201cbut really a high moment when we recognized we\u2019d solved the problem.\u201d Around the time the red crew completed its work, the U.S. Space Force, which operates the Eastern Range that includes KSC, said a radar needed to track the launch had malfunctioned, a problem traced to a faulty Ethernet switch. Replacing the switch took more than an hour. The successful launch came after two scrubbed attempts in late August and early September.  The first, Aug. 29, was called off when sensors indicated one of four RS-25 core stage engines had not properly cooled down , a problem later blamed on a faulty sensor. NASA scrubbed the second, Sept. 3,  after detecting a hydrogen leak during fueling of the core stage . NASA replaced damaged seals in the liquid hydrogen line and changed tanking procedures, which it successfully tested Sept. 21. However,  Hurricane Ian forced NASA to send the SLS back to the safety of the Vehicle Assembly Building  before making another attempt in a launch period that closed in early October. NASA rolled the SLS back to the pad Nov. 4, then had to wait as Hurricane Nicole passed through Nov. 10.  The storm caused \u201cvery minor\u201d damage  that mission managers concluded either could be repaired or was not a constraint to launch. That damage included a caulk material called RTV that had started to come off the interface between the Orion crew capsule and its launch abort system in the aftermath of the hurricane. Sarafin said imagery showed \u201ca couple indications\u201d that additional material came off during flight, but that engineers were still studying the data to determine what, if anything did come off Orion during ascent. Those earlier launch scrubs, though, were only minor setbacks for a launch vehicle whose development suffered extensive delays. The 2010 NASA Authorization Act, which instructed NASA to develop SLS, called for the vehicle to be ready by the end of 2016. Various technical issues, primarily with the rocket\u2019s core stage, steadily pushed back the first flight of the vehicle until now. The Artemis 1 mission will see the Orion spacecraft, without astronauts on board, go to the moon and enter a distant retrograde orbit there. Orion will remain in that orbit for five days, reaching a maximum distance from Earth of 480,500 kilometers. It will then depart the orbit and return to Earth, splashing down off the coast of San Diego, California, at 12:40 p.m. Eastern Dec. 11. The 25-day mission is considered a \u201cshort-class\u201d mission by NASA, versus missions of up to 42 days that Orion would have flown in two earlier launch attempts. The shorter mission will still achieve all the test objectives, but in a more compressed timeframe. \u201cWe did proofs of concept early on to demonstrate that you can fit all the objects the program has decided they want us to accomplish into the shortest class mission,\u201d said Emily Nelson, NASA chief flight director, in a Nov. 14 interview. \u201cBut, it\u2019s much more of a Tetris puzzle to make sure all of those things fit in.\u201d Those plans are revised for each launch opportunity. \u201cEach different launch opportunity is a new challenge in terms of when is the spacecraft in the right place to accomplish those different mission objectives,\u201d she said. Artemis 1 is designed to test the Orion spacecraft in cislunar space, including testing the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield when reentering at lunar return velocities. It will be followed by Artemis 2, the first crewed Orion mission, no earlier than 2024.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/sls-launches-artemis-1-mission/"}, "8": {"title": "Defense Innovation Unit selects contractors to build hybrid space network", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Innovation Unit awarded contracts to Anduril, Aalyria Technologies, Atlas Space Operations and Enveil for a project that seeks to demonstrate a hybrid architecture where commercial, civil and military satellites can share data. DIU, based in Silicon Valley, was created to tap technologies from the commercial market for military applications. Its hybrid space architecture project is being done in collaboration with the Space Force and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Atlas Space  last month announced its DIU award. The agency said more contracts are expected from the same solicitation.  \u201cHybrid space communications is the next great leap forward,\u201d DIU said in a statement.  Rogan Shimmin, DIU program manager, said the initial goals are to demonstrate on-demand collection and analysis of imagery and other tactical data collected by commercial and government satellites operating in different orbits. On-orbit demonstrations are planned within 24 months, said DIU. The project will focus on four main areas: A secure software defined network  to integrate diverse telecom systems across low, medium and geostationary orbits, and cislunar space. There is currently limited communication between systems across orbits. Combining data from multiple sources  will require common data standards and interfaces, and common command and control interfaces to manage data collection will be necessary. Cloud-based analytics  using artificial intelligence and machine learning  A variable trust protocol  to protect information. According to DIU, \u201cwe must ensure that we do not introduce vulnerabilities through the increased access points. Due to the broad variety of participating networks, each link and each node will be dynamically assigned a trust score based on observed behavior within the architecture. The traffic can then be routed over preferred links based on sensitivity and timeliness. Speaking last month at a National Security Space Association event, Steve \u201cBucky\u201d Butow, director of DIU\u2019s space portfolio, said the hybrid space architecture will help support a Pentagon effort to connect diverse networks known as  Joint All-Domain Command and Control. \u201cUltimately our goal is secure, assured multipath communications that serves the commercial, civil and national security space, not just in LEO but in all orbits, and it should be scalable,\u201d said Butow.  With regard to cybersecurity, he said, a hybrid network needs to provide security but also ensure access. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna have an internet of things, and they\u2019re all gonna be connected through the hybrid architecture, you can\u2019t use encryption methods that typically we use with small constellations. We have to move more to a zero trust architecture.\u201d The project also will look at different ways to manage data transport, said Butow. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of companies that are responsible for moving data between GEO and MEO and LEO, from space to ground and ground to space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to take advantage of all that data transport architecture, and to make sure that we have both the least expensive but also the most responsive ways to move critical information to users who need it.\u201d The hybrid space architecture will be designed to support commercial industry\u2019s revenue models, Butow said. \u201cWe want to make it easy for them to exchange their data with end users in a revenue positive model.

Aschbacher said Ariane 6 is set to fly \u201csome time\u201d in 2023 during a  BBC interview  without giving a reason for the delay. Just a few weeks ago, a senior executive for Arianespace said it was preparing to conduct the inaugural launch  toward the end of 2022  from Europe\u2019s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Arianespace referred questions to ESA, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ariane 6 had previously been scheduled to debut in 2020 before suffering multiple delays following the COVID-19 pandemic. The next-generation launcher comes in two versions: Ariane 64 with four boosters and Ariane 62 with two. They are designed to replace Europe\u2019s heavy-lift Ariane 5 and the medium-lift Soyuz rocket sourced from Russia, respectively. Arianespace expects to deploy satellites for Europe\u2019s Galileo navigation constellation with Ariane 6 in  the mission that follows  its inaugural launch. Ariane 6 commercial customers include Viasat and  Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper megaconstellation .  Europe is also developing a successor to Vega, its small launch vehicle, called Vega C. According to an ESA media invitation June 7, Arianespace is due to conduct Vega C\u2019s inaugural launch July 7 at 7:13 a.m. Eastern from Kourou. Giulio Ranzo, CEO of Italian rocket maker Avio that is Vega\u2019s prime contractor and a subcontractor for Ariane 6, discussed development timelines for both launchers in a recent  SpaceNews interview . Aschbacher also said during the BBC interview that Europe has still \u201cnot decided what will happen or [what] will be the future\u201d of the ExoMars rover mission it had shared with Russia.

They wrote that their interest, not usually seen in other commercial launch failures, stems from the fact that New Shepard also carries people. \u201cOn a different day with a different mission, this vehicle\u2019s anomaly could have put human lives in danger,\u201d they wrote. The particular vehicle involved in the failure had only been used for uncrewed flights; a different New Shepard vehicle has flown Blue Origin\u2019s crewed flights since July 2021. Beyer and Babin, the chair and ranking member, respectively, of the House Science Committee\u2019s space subcommittee, mentioned their responsibility of providing oversight of the FAA\u2019s commercial space transportation office and commercial launch and reentry in general for their desire for more information into the investigation, including, ultimately the root cause and steps to correct the problem that caused it They also asked for a briefing of subcommittee staff within 10 days. The letter was not the first time Beyer commented on the accident. \u201cToday\u2019s booster failure of NS-23 is a compelling reminder of the risks of spaceflight,\u201d Beyer said in a statement hours after the incident. \u201cAs commercial human spaceflight is now a reality, the subcommittee\u2019s work on the safety of commercial human spaceflight is more important than ever.\u201d Neither the FAA nor Blue Origin have provided more details about the incident, when an apparent problem with the vehicle\u2019s booster triggered the launch escape motor of the capsule, taking it safely away from the booster. The capsule, carrying three dozen payloads that included a number of NASA-sponsored experiments, landed safely under parachutes several minutes later. Blue Origin said the booster was destroyed. The FAA confirmed Sept. 12 that it was leading the investigation into the accident. That work would have gone to the National Transportation Safety Board, under terms of an agreement the agencies signed Sept. 9, had anyone been killed or seriously injured, or if debris that could have caused death or serious injury fell outside the launch site. A Blue Origin executive, Jarrett Jones, said at World Satellite Business Week Sept. 13 that  it was still \u201csuper early\u201d into the investigation .

The study will be conducted by the U.S.-based satellite broadband operator\u2019s British subsidiary, which will spend a year evaluating technical requirements and potential markets for hybrid networks that combine multiple frequency bands and network architectures. These include systems in geostationary orbit (GEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), low Earth orbit (LEO) and High Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS) such as balloons and airships. John Reeves, managing director of Viasat UK, said the company will research how multi-layer networks \u201ccan increase capability, resilience, and performance for end-users across commercial and government.\u201d Viasat UK provides communications solutions mainly for the British government, particularly for data security and information insurance applications. Carlsbad, California-headquartered Viasat is currently working through regulatory approvals to buy British satellite operator Inmarsat in a $7.3 billion deal, which would expand the U.S. company\u2019s Ka-band GEO constellation globally into other spectrum bands.  Inmarsat operates a fleet in GEO but has plans for satellites in LEO and highly elliptical orbits (HEO) that can maximize a satellite\u2019s dwell time over higher latitudes. Meanwhile, the European Union  is seeking to develop  a multibillion-dollar LEO constellation to fill broadband access gaps in Europe and Africa.  The proposed sovereign constellation \u2014 which is in very early stages \u2014 also aims to provide secure communications for European governments and military organizations through quantum encryption technologies. A consortium including European satellite makers, operators, service and launch providers has been helping Europe study the constellation\u2019s feasibility. Two other groups of mostly early-stage space companies have also been studying the proposed network: New Symphonie, which French companies lead, and UN:IO which is led by businesses based in Germany. Viasat expects to complete its study for ESA in the second quarter of 2023 to give the U.K., Europe and allied nations \u201cimportant guidance on a pathway toward developing and harnessing the potential of resilient multi-layered\u201d satellite communications capabilities. Viasat declined to disclose the amount of funding it will receive from ESA for the study. \u201cThe study will focus on understanding how combining orbital regimes can create future systems that more efficiently use all available resources on orbit,\u201d Viasat spokesperson Daniel Bleier said.

French startup Pollen Robotics captured the $2 million second-place prize. Team Northeastern from Boston won $1 million for coming in third. Seventeen teams from 10 countries competed in the two-day finals of the ANA Avatar XPrize at the Long Beach Convention Center. The space exploration theme was designed to help validate the avatar technology for space-related tasks, while engaging the public. It was the first public XPrize testing event since the $10 million Ansari XPrize was claimed in 2004 by a team led by aerospace engineer Burt  Rutan  and backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. \u201cOne of the applications of this type of technology is for harsh environments, where a human would have a difficult time,\u201d Anousheh Ansari, XPrize Foundation CEO and one of the founders of the Ansari XPrize, told  SpaceNews.  \u201cIt could be a fire or a nuclear-meltdown situation, but also the environment of space is not very friendly to human body. It definitely can be a means of exploring extreme environments and surfaces through a means where you\u2019re not only having a robot send pictures to you.

Avatars could, for example, help business travelers connect with families at home or enable people to visit relatives in remote locations. The space scenario is also \u201cvery meaningful because robotic systems could allow humans to go into areas they could not otherwise access,\u201d Kajitani said. Ansari, who spent eight days on the International Space Station in 2006, said \u201cthe ability to see the world through that lens was transformational. That lens gave me a different way of prioritizing everything in my life.\u201d Since it would be impossible for everyone on Earth to travel to low-Earth orbit, \u201chow do you bring that experience back to them? Being able to use an avatar system to get close to that experience would be still transformational because it goes beyond seeing pictures of Earth from space,\u201d Ansari said. \u201cIf you spend enough time in an avatar suit, seeing through the robot\u2019s eyes, your brain starts to think you are the robot.\u201d In the ANA Avatar XPrize finals, the remote-controlled robots were judged on their interaction with a human commander who explained the challenge and their ability to perform a series of tasks including moving a lever, traversing a 25-meter course lined with boulders, weigh and manipulate canisters, use a battery-powered drill and select a rock based on its texture. \u201cWe made it very difficult,\u201d Ansari said. \u201cOn the obstacle course, you\u2019re not only roving but picking things up that are difficult to pick up and moving the hands and fingers to use the drill.\u201d To succeed, ANA Avatar XPrize competitors must combine \u201cadvancements in mobility, robotics, artificial intelligence, advanced sensors and haptics,\u201d said David Locke, ANA Avatar Xprize senior program director.

Representatives of several countries currently involved in the ISS said during a panel at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\u2019 ASCEND conference here Oct. 25 that they are looking at options for how to continue work they currently do on the ISS on the commercial space stations in low Earth orbit (LEO) NASA is helping develop to replace it at the end of the decade. \u201cWith the commercialization of LEO, it is really necessary to revisit our principles of doing cooperation,\u201d said Peter Gr\u00e4f, director of applications and science at the German space agency DLR. Germany is the biggest contributor to ESA\u2019s share of the ISS and actively uses the station for fundamental and applied research.

Such arrangements are unlikely to work for commercial stations, however. \u201cWe need to find a new way of cooperating,\u201d said Nicolas Maubert, space counselor at the French Embassy in the U.S. and representative of the French space agency CNES in the U.S., citing the challenges of extending current barter arrangements to commercial stations. \u201cWe need to put on the table every option.\u201d The simplest approach \u2014 direct payments from space agencies to the companies operating commercial stations \u2014 could face political obstacles. \u201cThe taxpayers in Europe don\u2019t want to pay directly to private American companies,\u201d he said. He suggested Europe might consider developing its own space station as ESA members debate developing European human spaceflight capabilities. \u201cHaving autonomous capabilities is one of the solutions,\u201d he said, one he acknowledged would depend on budgets. Another option is for companies in other countries to be part of the U.S.-led ventures developing commercial stations. Thales Alenia, for example, is manufacturing modules for Axiom Space and builds components for Northrop Grumman\u2019s Cygnus spacecraft that will be adapted for use on its proposed station.

We need to first find out how we\u2019re moving on with the ISS.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line for all is that there is a strong demand for capabilities in low Earth orbit,\u201d Gr\u00e4f said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear there will be a human outpost in LEO, no matter what the future will bring.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/iss-partners-weigh-options-for-using-commercial-space-stations/"}, "17": {"title": "Chinese commercial methane-fueled rocket set for first launch", "content": "HELSINKI \u2014 Landspace is preparing for a test launch of its Zhuque-2 rocket in what could be a marker for the progress being made by Chinese commercial launch companies.

Landspace first  unveiled  the Zhuque-2 project at the 2018 International Astronautical Congress (IAC) ahead of its Zhuque-1 launch. It initially targeted a test launch for 2020. Last November the company\u2019s  CEO Zhang Changwu said in an  interview  that Zhuque-2 could lift off in the first quarter of 2022.  In the global context, Zhuque-2 will also be the first orbital launch of a methane-fueled rocket from a field of in-development launch systems. These include SpaceX\u2019s Starship, the ULA Vulcan, Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn, Rocket Lab\u2019s Neutron and Terran 1 from Relativity Space. Landspace is one of the earliest and  best-funded  of China\u2019s emerging commercial launch firms. The launch will be only the second to be attempted by Landspace. The first, with the much smaller and simpler solid-propellant Zhuque-1,  ended in failure . It was however a milestone in that it marked the first flight of a launch by a privately-funded Chinese launch firm. ISpace and Galactic Energy have since reached orbit, with the latter having succeeded with all four launches of its  Ceres-1  solid rocket to date. Three  consecutive failures  from iSpace have however added a perceived amount of pressure on private firms to succeed, as their performance is seen to be tied to the overall image of China\u2019s space endeavors. Beijing-based iSpace is developing its own methalox rocket, the Hyperbola-2. The firm recently  unveiled  a first stage test article at Jiuquan in preparation to conduct hop tests.  Galactic Energy is meanwhile  developing  its two-stage, kerosene-liquid oxygen Pallas-1, designed to carry 5,000 kilograms to LEO or 3,000 kilograms to a 700-kilometer SSO. Both could launch in 2023.  Another firm, Deep Blue Aerospace, has begun  hop tests  for its planned Nebula-1 reusable kerolox launcher. Officials from China\u2019s main space contractor CASC have also presented concepts for reusable,  methalox launchers  and a methane-powered  version  of the Long March 9. Its main Shanghai rocket-making institute is  looking  at methalox launch solutions. China\u2019s government has sought to foster the development of commercial space with policy support and guidance, including regulations for  launch  and  small satellites  and national strategies supporting \u201c satellite internet .\u201d Investment , from a mix of venture capital and government-linked investment vehicles, has also flowed in recent years.  A number of commercial  launch companies  are stating the national satellite internet project as a potential source of contracts and revenue. The military-civilian fusion national strategy has also allowed production of sensitive, dual-use technologies to take place in the private sector. Methane-LOX engines have been  under study  by CASC prior to the  development of commercial Chinese methane rocket engines.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/chinese-commercial-methane-fueled-rocket-set-for-first-launch/"}, "18": {"title": "Shay Har-Noy takes the helm at Edgybees", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Shay Har-Noy, former Spire Global general manager for aviation and a former DigitalGlobe and Maxar Technologies vice president, has taken the helm at Edgybees, a company that specializes in aligning satellite and aerial still and full-motion imagery. Har-Noy, who previously founded and led geospatial crowdsourcing platform Tomnod, became the CEO of Edgybees to tackle what he sees as the fundamental challenge in the Earth-observation sector now. \u201cOn the commercial space imaging side, the days of data snacking are over,\u201d Har-Noy told  SpaceNews . Customers, no longer satisfied with intermittent access to Earth imagery, seek accurate, reliable datasets delivered on a dependable schedule. And customers who acquire multiple datasets, need the imagery to \u201csing together, to form a coherent and authoritative picture,\u201d Har-Noy said. What Har-Noy means is that various imagery sources should be georegistered, or linked with exact geographic locations. Plus, satellite imagery captured from various angles, in different spectral bands and light conditions needs to be aligned together, Har-Noy said. Large Earth-observation satellites such as those built by Airbus Defence and Space and Maxar \u201chave expensive components and incur substantial costs to ensure the accurate precision-pointing of onboard cameras,\u201d Har-Noy said.  \u201cWhile georegistration is still a problem for them, the opportunity for software-based georegistration is particularly ripe for small satellite constellations which offer potential for greater revisit and lower costs.\u201d Edgybees software \u201ctakes imagery from satellite and airborne platforms and makes it consistent and reliable, such that they can be leveraged for AI and for mapping,\u201d Har-Noy said. \u201cWe\u2019re making great headway working with some of these commercial operators as well as with end customers.\u201d \u201cI see an opportunity for the commercial space players to improve their data to meet the specifications their customers demand,\u201d Har-Noy said. \u201cThe most discerning customers, governments and large organizations that have contracts with more than one space imaging provider, need to be able to form a common picture by bringing the datasets together.\u201d Edgybees, founded in 2016 to develop augmented reality video games, quickly pivoted to augmenting full motion video imagery with graphic overlays to provide situational awareness. As a result, \u201cthe software was built from the ground up with performance and accuracy as a key tenet,\u201d Har-Noy said. More recently, Edgybees has rolled out the application of the company\u2019s technology to satellite imagery. For Edgybees, \u201csatellite is a relatively new venture,\u201d Har-Noy said. \u201cBut the software works extremely well and quickly.

Cyber and malware  attacks can be pulled off at a relatively low cost, making these types of weapons far more accessible than missiles or lasers.  This is an issue of growing concern for the U.S. Space Force, said  Lt. Gen. Stephen Whiting, commander of Space Operations Command. A key challenge for the Space Force is how to assess cyber security risks, Whiting said July 7 on the Space Policy Show, hosted by the Aerospace Corp.  \u201cThat\u2019s been on my mind recently: cyber security and how we measure risk in the cyber domain,\u201d said Whiting, who has  described the cyber domain  as the \u201c soft underbelly of our global space networks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s  a real issue and it\u2019s an issue that we\u2019ve asked for and gotten some help from the policy community,\u201d he said.  The military is more comfortable dealing with physical security threats whereas cybersecurity is a different problem that requires a nontraditional approach, he noted.  \u201cAt Peterson Space Force Base [Colorado] we have a fence around our installation, we have armed security forces members who are well trained on how to defend this installation,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cWe have security cameras, we have security alarms, all of that coming together. We\u2019re pretty comfortable understanding what our security posture is relative to the threat outside the gate, based on intelligence and law enforcement.\u201d Now contrast that with cybersecurity, he said, \u201cwhere we know there are countries that are trying to probe us in cyber, what we call advanced, persistent threat actors.

French media regulator Arcom said Dec. 14 it gave Eutelsat a week to stop broadcasting Rossiya 1, Perviy Kanal, and NTV via its satellites. Russia-based service providers NTV Plus and Trikolor currently use Eutelsat satellite capacity to broadcast these Russian-language channels to the west of the country.  It is unclear how removing the channels from Eutelsat transponders will reduce their reach because NTV Plus and Trikolor also use satellite capacity that is provided from outside the European Union. In a news release, Arcom said the television stations\u2019 coverage of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cinclude repeated incitement to hatred and violence and numerous shortcomings to the honesty of the information.\u201d Eutelsat said in a brief statement that \u201cit will no longer be involved in the broadcasting of the three sanctioned channels within the prescribed time-frame.\u201d Arcom\u2019s decision comes a week after France\u2019s top administrative court, prompted by a request from the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders advocacy group, ordered Arcom to review an initial decision to permit Eutelsat to continue carrying the stations. Arcom said it has the power to block the channels after an investigation found they \u201cwere broadcast not only in Russia, but also in the Ukrainian territories annexed by Russia.\u201d The regulator said: \u201cSince, unlike Russia, Ukraine has signed and ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, as has France, Arcom therefore has a legal basis to demand that Eutelsat cease broadcast of these channels.\u201d Eutelsat has been under mounting pressure to remove pro-Kremlin broadcasts from campaign groups seeking to curb Russian propaganda, which clashes with the company\u2019s strict policy of editorial neutrality.

Astra\u2019s Rocket 3.3 vehicle, designated LV0010, lifted off from Space Launch Complex 46 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1:43 p.m. Eastern. The liftoff took place near the end of a two-hour window that opened at 12 p.m. Eastern, after an initial launch attempt was stopped less than two minutes before liftoff because of an issue with the condition of the vehicle\u2019s liquid oxygen propellant. The launch initially went according to plan, with the first stage firing for three minutes, followed by engine shutdown, deployment of the payload fairing, and stage separation. The upper stage engine ignited for a burn intended to last 5 minutes and 15 seconds, according to a mission timeline distributed by the company. However, about four minutes into that burn, video from the rocket briefly showed a plume from the engine, after which the vehicle appeared to tumble. The planned time of engine shutdown and deployment of the rocket\u2019s payload of two cubesats passed in silence. The company soon acknowledged a mission failure. \u201cWe had a nominal first stage flight. The upper stage shut down early and we did not deliver the payloads to orbit,\u201d the company  tweeted . \u201cWe have shared our regrets with NASA and the payload team. More information will be provided after we complete a full data review.\u201d The failure is the second in three launch attempts for Astra this year. Another launch for NASA, also taking place from Cape Canaveral on Feb. 10,  failed when the payload fairing failed to separate , a problem the company traced to a flaw in the wiring diagram for the separation system. The company returned to flight March 15,  placing its first customer payloads into orbit on a launch from Kodiak Island, Alaska . The company has successfully reached orbit on only two of its first seven launches. This launch was  the first of three for NASA\u2019s Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) constellation , a set of six three-unit cubesats that carry microwave radiometers to measure temperature and precipitation in tropical storm systems. The full six-satellite constellation would have provided revisit times of less than an hour, allowing scientists to better track the formation of such storms, although the mission can still achieve its science goals with four satellites. The six TROPICS satellites would launch two at a time on three Astra rockets, each into different orbital planes. The preferred orbits of the mission \u2014 an altitude of 550 kilometers and an inclination of 29.75 degrees \u2014 optimized the science they could produce but drove a dedicated launch solution rather than launching them as secondary payloads. \u201cWe need to go to a 30-degree inclined orbit and no one else really wants to go there. The rideshares are all going to sun-synchronous orbits or mid-inclinations, so it\u2019s very well targeted to a smaller vehicle with a very targeted insertion where they can get us exactly where we want to go,\u201d said William Blackwell, principal investigator for TROPICS at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, in a video about the mission. NASA acknowledged, though, that it was taking greater risk with this approach. It awarded Astra a contract valued at $7.95 million for the three launches in February 2021, before the company\u2019s first successful launch. \u201cEven though we are disappointed right now, we know: There is value in taking risks in our overall NASA Science portfolio because innovation is required for us to lead,\u201d Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science,  tweeted  after the launch failure. \u201cI am confident that in the future we will succeed in using this valuable launch capability to explore the unknown and give others the same opportunity to inspire the world through discovery,\u201d he added.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/astra-launch-of-nasa-tropics-cubesats-fails/"}, "23": {"title": "Starship booster test ends in fiery anomaly", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A test of the booster for SpaceX\u2019s first orbital Starship vehicle July 11 ended with flames erupting unexpectedly from the base of the vehicle, triggering a fire at the pad.

The Canadian operator\u2019s application says the first of 198 Lightspeed satellites will be launched in the third quarter of 2025, British telecoms regulator Ofcom said June 24.  This is a narrower launch window than Telesat has previously outlined since supply chain issues forced it to  downsize plans for the constellation  by a third earlier this year. Initial services in the United Kingdom are slated for 2026, about a year later than Telesat had planned before it was hit by the pandemic-related supply shortages.  Ofcom said it is due to announce a decision on Telesat\u2019s request to connect user terminals, via a non-geostationary satellite Earth station network license, Sept. 12 following a public comment period. LEO broadband megaconstellations Starlink and OneWeb already have licenses that give them permission to connect satellites to user terminals in the U.K.  Starlink and OneWeb use Ku-band spectrum to connect to users and Ka-band frequencies for gateway Earth Stations, which link their constellations to the internet or a private network and require a separate U.K. license to operate. Telesat\u2019s planned terminals and gateways operate in Ka-band, and Ofcom said the company has not yet applied for permission to operate Earth stations in the United Kingdom. SpaceX\u2019s Starlink recently applied for permission to add  six more gateways in England  to improve services in the region, which is also subject to an Ofcom consultation.

The 75-meter-high steel structure, located in the south campus of Xidian University in Xi\u2019an, north China, hosts subsystems for testing a space-based solar power (SBSP) concept. It passed an acceptance inspection on June 5, according to a university  statement , three years ahead of schedule. The facility is designed to collect solar energy and convert it into direct current electricity. This is to then be converted into microwaves for transmission via an antenna over a distance of 55 meters.  It includes technologies for concentrating light and photoelectric conversion, conversion of energy into microwaves, microwave transmission and waveform optimization, microwave beam aiming measurement and control, and microwave reception and rectification. The work was led by Academician Duan Baoyan, a leading Chinese expert in SBSP. Duan is a co-author of the proposed  SSPS-OMEGA  (Orb-Shape Membrane Energy Gathering Array) concentrator system for generating electricity in geostationary orbit. The new facility is designed to test and verify technology for the OMEGA system. \u201cThe research on space solar power is currently a hot spot in the world,\u201d Duan said in the press release. He noted however that the realization of SBSP would take generations.  \u201cTo use an analogy, heaven and earth transmission is like common prosperity,\u201d Duan said, in a modified machine translation of the statement. \u201cThat is the ultimate goal and must take many years and many people to achieve it, but we can start working on it now and start from where it is most likely to be achieved.\u201d The OMEGA modular system is presented in comparison and contrast to NASA\u2019s proposed  SPS-ALPHA  (Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large Phased Array) project. Duan is part of a special expert team on SPS strategic research created by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) in 2014 which includes Long Lehao, a Long March rocket chief designer, who is involved in another Chinese SBSP concept. The Multi-Rotary joints SPS (MR-SPS) is proposed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), the country\u2019s main, state-owned spacecraft maker. In contrast to the \u201corb-shaped\u201d SSPS-OMEGA, it would involve numerous linear  solar arrays with multiple rotary joints to avoid single-point failure. It would require in-space assembly using free flying robotic spacecraft.

The Japanese conglomerate said June 2 it founded Sony Space Communications (SSC) in San Mateo, California, to help companies avoid running out of radio waves as the number of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) soars. SSC plans to develop, build and supply devices that would enable small satellites to use laser beams instead of radio frequencies to communicate with ground stations \u2014 and each other for real-time connectivity. The volume of data used in LEO is increasing every year but the amount of radio waves is limited, SSC president Kyohei Iwamoto said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, the need for frequency licenses for radio waves and the requirement for lower power consumption of communication equipment needed by smaller satellites, like micro satellites, are also issues to be addressed,\u201d he said. Conventional radio communications need larger satellite antennas and more power than optical networks, Sony said, making it \u201cphysically difficult\u201d to achieve high speeds on small satellites. Sony said it has been researching and developing optical communications systems that are small enough to fit microsatellites, which NASA defines as spacecraft between 10 and 100 kilograms. The company did not say when its devices could be available or if it had customers lined up for the technology. SSC plans to apply its optical disc technology to create satellite communication devices that are ultra-compact, lightweight, mass-producible and able to withstand harsh conditions in space. In 2020, Sony said an optical communications device it developed in cooperation with Japan\u2019s space agency was installed on Kibo, the Japanese experimental module on the International Space Station. According to Sony, SOLISS, or Small Optical Link for International Space Station, established a bidirectional laser communications link with a space optical communication ground station in Japan, and successfully transmitted high-definition image data. Sony also said it successfully conducted a data file transfer experiment this year that it says provides \u201cthe technological basis\u201d for internet services through LEO optical communications.

It turned out to be a really long list that eventually Calvelli boiled down to a  three-page memo  he released Oct. 31. \u201cAfter I started actually working on this, I realized I was writing a novel and no one was ever going to read this,\u201d he said Dec. 15 at a Washington Space Business Roundtable event near Capitol Hill.  At the top of Calvelli\u2019s list of nine \u201cspace acquisition tenets\u201d is to build smaller satellites using commercial components and production methods. He expects the U.S. Space Force to start transitioning to smaller satellites and end procurements of billion-dollar satellites that on average take seven years to develop. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Department to go faster in space acquisition,\u201d Calvelli said, amid concerns that China is building new constellations at a rapid pace to compete with the United States. Military space systems today are primarily  large satellites in geostationary orbits , and there is no easy or fast way to replace these assets if they were struck by anti-satellite weapons. \u201cWe have a need for resiliency in our architecture through things like orbit diversification and proliferation of satellites,\u201d said Calvelli. \u201cAs the threat to space systems continues to evolve, and as space becomes even more important to give advantages to our troops, timely delivery of capabilities becomes even more critical for the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo given the threat, and the need to drive speed into our space acquisition, I fundamentally believe that traditional ways of doing space acquisition must be reformed.\u201d Calvelli wants acquisition officers to avoid cost-plus contracts when at all possible and instead buy satellites at fixed prices, a model embraced by the Space Development Agency,  a Space Force agency that is procuring  a mesh network of small satellites in low Earth orbit. \u201cSpeed in space acquisition is a very simple formula,\u201d Calvelli said. \u201cYou build small, you use existing technology and reduce non recurring engineering. You take advantage of commercial capabilities and you execute.\u201d Cost-plus contracts \u2014 where the government pays for development costs and absorbs any cost overruns \u2014 incentivize vendors to add years to a program and make systems more complex than they need to be, he said.

The National Reconnaissance Office has talked about doing more fixed price contracts. Now the Space Force needs to be doing more fixed-price contracting.\u201d Calvelli\u2019s watch list for 2023 As Calvelli continues to push for changes in the Space Force procurement culture and contracting practices, there are some specific programs he will be watching closely next year.  One is United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan Centaur rocket, a new launch vehicle the Space Force selected for national security missions and is  years behind schedule  due to engine development delays. \u201cI want to see Vulcan fly in 2023. I look forward to that,\u201d Calvelli said. Other programs that Calvelli will be monitoring are the  next-generation OCX ground control system  for the Global Positioning System constellation, and a space-tracking system called ATLAS, short for  Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System . The long-delayed ATLAS was designed to replace an old legacy system, called SPADOC, used for tracking space objects. \u201cI want to see the retirement of SPADOC,\u201d said Calvelli. \u201cWe need to do that.\u201d With regard to OCX, \u201cI want to see OCX deliver,\u201d he said.

Earlier statements from the company laid out a 2023 target for establishing the 80-strong constellation, a timeline omitted from the latest press release.  However, instead of using dedicated satellites, the company has apparently chosen the route of arranging for its GNSS occultation (GNSS-RO) and GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) payloads to fly aboard the satellites of other firms. GNSS-RO remote sensing payloads in low Earth orbit are designed to pick up GPS, Beidou and other GNSS satellite signals, with changes to the signals as they pass through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and ionosphere providing data useful for weather forecasting and atmospheric processes, ionospheric research and other areas.  GNSS-R payloads collect signals reflected from the Earth\u2019s surface and can be used to monitor ocean, land and ice surfaces, wind state, soil moisture, sea levels and more.  Yunyao Aerospace has already sent a number of payloads into orbit, including aboard the small Baoyun satellite launched on a Ceres-1 solid rocket in December, on sats developed by  Changguang Satellite Technology  (CGST), a remote sensing satellite company.  Most recently Yunyao Yuhang saw its first dual-polarization L-band GNSS-R payload for ocean measurements sent into space aboard the Jilin-1 Kuanfu 01C satellite  launched  May 3. Yunyao Aerospace and CGST signed a  deal  in 2020 for carrying 23 GNSS occultation payloads.

SLS managers and agency leaders said the work to prepare the SLS and the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis 1 mission inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at the Kennedy Space Center was \u201con plan\u201d to support a rollout to the pad Aug. 18 and a launch 11 days later. \u201cWe are in the final stretch,\u201d Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis 1 launch director at KSC, said at a briefing to preview the mission. \u201cWe are targeting that rollout date of Aug. 18. We are on plan for that at this time.\u201d A rollout that day would allow a launch on Aug. 29. Since  NASA announced the targeted launch date July 20 , crews have been working on both SLS and Orion, ranging from completing repairs to the rocket to installing payloads inside the Orion capsule. Technicians also powered on Orion for the final time before launch last weekend. One remaining item to complete is testing of the rocket\u2019s flight termination system (FTS) in the \u201cintertank\u201d portion of the core stage. That testing will begin next week, she said. The FTS could complicate launch planning for Artemis 1. At a July 20 briefing, NASA officials said the Eastern Range requires testing 15 days prior to launch. Doing so, said Cliff Lanham, senior vehicle operations manager for the Exploration Ground Systems program, creates \u201csome challenges\u201d to complete close-out work on schedule. The testing also starts a 20-day clock to conduct the launch. \u201cWe do have issues with that timing,\u201d he said then, to support backup launch opportunities on Sept. 2 and Sept. 5. NASA was working with the range to try and resolve those concerns. At the Aug. 3 briefing, Blackwell-Thompson said those discussions with the range are ongoing. \u201cWe have provided all the performance data to the range,\u201d she said. \u201cThe range has that data. They\u2019re reviewing it currently.\u201d Current plans, she said, would allow two launches in that 20-day period. \u201cWe\u2019ll be continuing to review that data with the range and, should additional days become available, we will factor that into our scrub planning.\u201d The briefing offered few other new details about the mission, instead providing the overview of the flight. The SLS will send the uncrewed Orion spacecraft to the moon, where the Orion service module\u2019s main thruster will fire for a \u201cpowered fly-by\u201d of the moon, placing it in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon. Orion will later exit the orbit and return to Earth, splashing down off the coast of San Diego Oct. 10, assuming a launch Aug. 29. The mission will test both SLS and Orion before Artemis 2, the first mission to carry astronauts, scheduled for no earlier than 2024. \u201cWe have a \u2018lean forward\u2019 strategy on Artemis 1 because it is an uncrewed test flight,\u201d said Mike Sarafin, Artemis 1 mission manager at NASA Headquarters. That means sending Orion to the moon even if there may be issues with the spacecraft in order to bring it back, testing the mission\u2019s primary objective of demonstrating that Orion\u2019s heat shield can work at lunar reentry velocities. \u201cWe will be \u2018go\u2019 for failures on Artemis 1 that we would normally be \u2018no go\u2019 for on Artemis 2, on a crewed mission, in the interest of crew safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to buy down risk for crewed flights, so we\u2019re willing to take more risk on Artemis 1, on an uncrewed test flight, than we would on later crewed flights.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a 42-day mission,\u201d added NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, noting additional tests planned for the spacecraft. \u201cJust remember, it\u2019s a test flight.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/first-sls-launch-remains-on-schedule-for-late-august/"}, "38": {"title": "New guidance from Space Force acquisition boss: \u2018The traditional ways must be reformed\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than six months after being sworn in as the  Space Force\u2019s procurement chief , Frank Calvelli has issued a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for the acquisition workforce. In an Oct. 31 memo, Calvelli laid out nine \u201cspace acquisition tenets\u201d intended to drive change in the procurement of satellites and space systems in general.  The guidelines in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by  SpaceNews , echo concerns previously voiced by Calvelli about the  slow pace and high cost  of Space Force satellite procurements. Calvelli\u2019s boss, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, has called for the Space Force to  innovate faster  to counter China\u2019s advancements in space technology and anti-satellite weapons. \u201cThe traditional ways of doing space acquisition must be reformed in order to add speed to our acquisitions to meet our priorities,\u201d Calvelli wrote in the memo.  \u201cTo gain speed we must shorten development timelines by building smaller satellites, acquiring ground and software intensive systems in smaller more manageable pieces that can be delivered faster, using existing technology and designs.\u201d Calvelli is the first assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisitions and integration, a new post created by  Congress  due to concerns that there are too many agencies overseeing space procurements and the Space Force should have its own civilian leader to oversee acquisitions. The nine tenets, Calvelli said, are intended to help develop a new space acquisition philosophy: Build smaller satellites,  smaller ground systems and minimize non-recurring engineering. Use existing technology and designs. Acquire ground and software intensive systems in smaller more manageable pieces that can be delivered faster. Get the acquisition strategy correct,  including contract type and contract incentives for both speed and performance. Have clear, specific, unambiguous statements of work, minimize and avoid government furnished equipment and avoid putting the government in the middle of multiple contracts as the integrator. Do not be afraid to use fixed price contracts.  Enable teamwork  between contracting officers and program managers, and they preferably should be collocated. Award contracts with realistic cost and schedule targets  to avoid low bids and buy-ins. Ensure companies have the correct skills to successfully execute the contract. Understand what companies are capable of doing or not doing. Maintain stability in programs.  Push back on year-to-year budget changes that drive rebaselining and slow down acquisitions. Avoid accepting new requirements after going on contract. Avoid over-classifying.  Putting programs in the \u201cspecial access program\u201d  category hinders the integration of space capabilities across other domains and can hinder getting ideas from a broader pool of industry. Avoid classifying systems as \u201cno foreign\u201d to enable future sharing with allies. Deliver ground before launch.  Ensure ground systems are completed and ready for operations before launch of a new capability.  Hold industry accountable for results.  Do not tolerate bad performance that we have seen in some traditional large satellite and ground systems cost-plus contracts. Take corrective action and consider all tools available for poor performers including loss of fee, use of the Contractor Responsibility Watch List, and if necessary, stopping programs. Industry works for you, so be a demanding customer. Execute and deliver capabilities that work,  on schedule and on cost. Identify issues early in order to quickly resolve them. \u201cThis is our most important tenet.

A Long March 2C rocket lifted off from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China at 6:53 p.m. Eastern (2253 UTC) Oct. 12, with insulation tiles falling away from the upper stage as the rocket  rose into the sky . The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC)  confirmed  launch success within the hour. The launch is China\u2019s 18th since early August. Aboard was the S-band S-SAR01 satellite, also named as Huanjing-2E, adding to a series of satellites for environmental monitoring. The satellite carries a deployable truss antenna,  similar  to that on the Huanjing-1C satellite launched in 2012. An object associated with the launch was  tracked  in a 498 by 763-kilometer orbit inclined by 97.65 degrees. The 5-meter resolution S-band radar image data from S-SAR01 will support \u201cdisaster prevention, reduction, relief, and environmental protection,\u201d and also \u201cserve natural resources, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, earthquakes, and other fields,\u201d  according  to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). Its main users will be the Ministry of Emergency Management and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, according to Chinese state media.  The satellite was built by DFH Satellite Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), the main spacecraft maker under CASC. The Long March 2C was provided by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), also under CASC. The launch of Huanjing-2E follows the Huanjing-2A and 2B medium resolution optical satellites  launched  in 2020, which replaced the 1A and 1B satellites launched in 2008. The satellite adds to the country\u2019s growing SAR capabilities while a series of  commercial SAR constellations  also appear to be in the works, some involving public-private partnerships. Days earlier China  launched  the Advanced Space-borne Solar Observatory (ASO-S), the country\u2019s first dedicated satellite for  studying the sun . Launch took place at 7:43 p.m. Eastern (23:43 UTC) Oct. 8, with the four-year-mission seeking to provide insight into the relationship between the sun\u2019s magnetic fields and solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The mission was preceded by the  launch  of a pair of navigation enhancement satellites, named CentiSpace-1 S5 and S6, just under 36 hours earlier.  The duo were sent into orbit by a Long March 11 solid rocket lifting off from a converted barge for providing mobile offshore launch. The launch was China\u2019s fourth sea launch as the country seeks to grow a satellite and launch ecosystem around the sea launch facilities at Haiyang in the eastern province of Shandong. The launches were China\u2019s 43rd, 44th and 45th of 2022. The vast majority have been conducted by CASC,  which is planning more than 50 launches across 2022. CASC is currently gearing up to  launch  the third and final Tiangong space station module late in October.

Euroconsult expects constellation operators to rely on orbital transfer vehicles to move satellites into multiple orbital planes, decreasing the constellation operators\u2019 reliance on dedicated launch vehicles. \u201cIndeed, most of the small to medium constellations\u2019 demand by orbital planes are either too large for micro or small launchers or too small for medium or heavy ones,\u201d Puteaux said by email. It remains to be seen how the adoption of onboard propulsion by satellite developers influences the last-mile logistics market. Satellites with powerful onboard propulsion may not need to hitch rides on orbital transfer vehicles. A widespread perception of unmet demand for moving around small satellites in orbit is attracting companies to the last-mile logistics sector. Italian firms D-Orbit and Group of Astrodynamics for the Use of Space Systems (GAUSS) as well as U.S. companies Momentus, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and Spaceflight Inc. have developed, manufactured, tested or flown orbital transfer vehicles. Seven additional companies are preparing to enter the market with initial flights scheduled in the next three years. The companies are: Atomos, Exotrail, Firefly Aerospace, Launcher, Space Machines, Exolaunch and Impulse Space. It\u2019s too soon to say how many of these companies will prosper in the last-mile delivery market, which in the future, is not likely to be limited to low-Earth orbit as it is now. \u201cOperators are eyeing transportation of larger satellites and more distant orbits, such as geostationary or even beyond-Earth orbits for exploration,\u201d Puteaux said. Vehicles designed to serve larger satellites and distant orbits will require powerful propulsion systems. In addition, reusability through on-orbit refueling will also be \u201ca key enabler,\u201d Puteaux said. If powerful, reusable orbital transfer vehicles come online, satellite operators may \u201cadapt their satellites\u2019 designs to leverage the service, for instance by installing docking ports for towing or removing part of the propulsion system and fuel to increase payload capacity,\u201d Puteaux said. Demand for orbital transfer vehicles will also be determined by the emergence of super heavy launch vehicles. A reduction in launch costs produced by the giant rockets could lower the cost of last-mile service. At the same time, giant rockets could spur demand for orbital transfer vehicles by increasing the number of satellites released in similar orbits from super heavy rideshare missions, Puteaux said.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/euroconsult-last-mile-logistics/"}, "41": {"title": "Report: U.S. should push for global rules on space traffic management", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Commercial and government activities in outer space are increasingly endangered by rapidly growing congestion in the  space environment . And it\u2019s unclear how much longer industries and governments can continue to operate safely in space without globally coordinated space traffic management, says a  new report  from the Atlantic Council. The report by the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security urges the U.S. government and allies to push for an international framework for space traffic management. Maxar Technologies provided funding for the report.  There is an urgent need for an \u201cinternational coordinating authority to lead on space traffic management,\u201d argue the authors,  Mir Sadat  and  Julia Siegel . This could be done through an existing organization, such as the United Nations\u2019  I nternational Civil Aviation Organization , or the crea tion of a new organization with proper authorities. A central message in the report is that it is no longer sufficient to know the location of spacecraft and space debris. As space becomes more crowded, \u201cit is imperative to have a common understanding of and management over maneuver in a congested environment.\u201d U.S. Space Command currently is tracking 35,000 space objects. This is just a small fraction of objects orbiting Earth and only a subset of the debris that can harm spacecraft, the report says. Many governments, corporations and international organizations track space objects and notify satellite operators when the probability of collision is notable. But it is ultimately up to the operators to determine whether and when they will move their spacecraft.  This decentralized system has worked so far but may not be adequate to prevent collisions in the future, Mir and Siegel write. \u201cThe United States should urgently lead on a globally coordinated policy framework for space traffic management, else the space domain will remain on an unsustainable path endangering national imperatives.\u201d The report calls on the U.S. Congress to examine the capabilities of the  Office of Space Commerce  \u2013 the Department of Commerce organization assigned to take over space traffic management duties. Lawmakers should look into whether this office is equipped to do this job, and has the structure, mandate and funding to oversee national space traffic management. Another recommendation is for the U.S. government to provide standards for satellites that lack maneuvering capability. \u201cAchieving security, economic, and societal objectives in the 21st century hinges on free and open access to outer space,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe current regulatory vacuum on space traffic management leaves room for malign activity and unsustainable business practices \u2026 Now is the time to act and protect a future of security and prosperity in space.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/report-u-s-should-push-for-global-rules-on-space-traffic-management/"}, "42": {"title": "Commercial space station developers seek clarity on regulations", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Companies working on commercial space stations intended to succeed the International Space Station say they need more clarity from the federal government on who will regulate them and how. During panel discussions at the Beyond Earth Symposium here Oct. 13, representatives of several of the companies working on commercial space stations said they have to deal with an \u201calphabet soup\u201d of agencies, none of which today have the authority to provide oversight of their operations as required under the Outer Space Treaty. \u201cWe need to figure these things out now so that we don\u2019t have problematic issues that slow down the engineering and the scientific and commercial progress in the future,\u201d said Mike Gold, executive vice president for civil space and external affairs at Redwire Space, which is a partner on the Orbital Reef commercial space station concept. \u201cWe need to have predictability, we need to have clarity and we need to have certainty in terms of the regulatory structure.\u201d No federal agency today has the authority to provide the authorization and continuing supervision of commercial space stations required under Article 6 of the Outer Space Treaty. Similar gaps in authority exist for other emerging commercial space fields, like satellite servicing and lunar landers. \u201cWe have to be careful of the absolute alphabet soup of agencies that we have to go to conduct our operations,\u201d he said. They include the Federal Communications Commission for communications licenses, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for remote sensing licenses and the Federal Aviation Administration for launch licenses and payload reviews. Those reviews can involve other agencies, like the Commerce and Defense Departments. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we consolidate and simplify not only because it makes it easier on the private sector, it will also result in better safety and better innovation.\u201d Those issues are growing larger as the companies make progress towards first launches of space station elements, although with some schedule slips. Mary Lynne Dittmar, chief government and external relations officer at Axiom Space, said her company now plans to launch its first commercial module to be installed on the ISS in late 2025, about a year later than previously planned. She said the company just \u201crebaselined\u201d that schedule as it goes through a critical design review of the module. A second module, a clone of the first, would follow in six to eight months. Asked what regulatory changes were required to enable Axiom\u2019s commercial space station and others, she noted many issues are interconnected. A key issue, though, is mission authorization. \u201cI want to understand how it is that\u2019s going to be framed, where that\u2019s going to sit, because there are a lot of other issues that tie directly to it.\u201d Gold said that mission authorization includes figuring out how to do the \u201ccontinuing supervision\u201d required by Article 6. He called for a \u201cself-certification\u201d approach for that. \u201cWe\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat and understand the technology more than anyone, so it\u2019s very important that, from a regulatory perspective, the private sector should be on the front lines of delivering that information to the government,\u201d he said. There is no shortage of concepts for how to carry out mission authorization. George Nield, former associate administrator for commercial space transportation at the FAA, suggested placing it within the Department of Transportation. \u201cMy recommendation is that we take this opportunity to recognize spaceflight as a mode of transportation, just like highways, railways, maritime, aviation and pipelines, and create a Bureau of Commercial Space Transportation under the U.S. Department of Transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be a one-stop shop for regulating space.\u201d In the near term, simply having a checklist of agencies to deal with for mission authorization would be helpful, said Eric Stallmer, executive vice president of government affairs and public policy at Voyager Space, which is working on its Starlab commercial space station. \u201cIt\u2019s something we all could follow,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sky is not falling yet,\u201d said Erika Wagner, senior director for emerging space markets at Blue Origin, a lead partner on Orbital Reef, noting the success of private astronaut missions like Inspiration4 and Ax-1. \u201cThe question is, how do we manage that uncertainty and the risk that comes with not having a clear path.\u201d There are other regulatory issues beyond mission authorization for commercial space station developers to grapple with. Gold noted that the ISS enjoys exceptions and prioritizations for export control regulations that commercial space stations will need.  Commercial space stations may also pose challenges for workplace safety and related regulations. Wagner noted that NASA uses career radiation limits for its astronauts, while terrestrial industries have annual radiation limits. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work very well if you\u2019re going to build a cadre of folks that are working privately on a space station.\u201d Those visiting commercial space stations, either as tourists or researchers, will expect some minimum standard of care to ensure their safety, said Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientific officer for the Translational Research Institute for Space Health at the Baylor College of Medicine. It may be too early, though, to have the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the branch of the Department of Labor that regulates workplace safety, get involved. \u201cI would not advocate for OSHA playing a role in this, but I think there are best practices that come out of it that could develop into something that benefits any of the providers,\u201d she said, adding that companies will have an incentive to make sure customers of commercial stations have a good experience. \u201cIf you want good word of mouth, I suggest you work really hard at that.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/commercial-space-station-developers-seek-clarity-on-regulations/"}, "43": {"title": "Kendall: Power competition in space becoming more destabilizing", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States wants space to be a peaceful domain for scientific and commercial pursuits, said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall.

NASA will also conduct an \u201corderly transition\u201d from existing, decades-old suits on the ISS to the new suits around the same time. NASA earlier planned to develop suits internally though an effort known as the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or xEMU, but shifted gears to a services model with competition, building on the accomplishments of commercial cargo and crew transportation. NASA is making xEMU data and other capabilities available to the companies to support their work. \u201cI really believe that all of that data is helping to reduce the risk and speed that transition process up to the contractor community,\u201d said Lara Kearney, manager of the extravehicular activity and human surface mobility program at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. \u201cWe were at a great place to transition just because of how mature the xEMU was at the time.\u201d Axiom, which is working with a team of companies that includes David Clark Company, KBR and Paragon Space Development Corporation, intended to develop spacesuits to support its commercial space station plans. \u201cWe have a number of customers who already would like to do a spacewalk,\u201d explained Michael Suffredini, president and chief executive of Axiom, said at the briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to have a partnership where we can benefit from the years of experience that NASA has and all the work they\u2019ve done to advance designs.\u201d Collins Aerospace, working with ILC Dover and Oceaneering, plans to make use of experience that includes development of the Apollo moonwalking suits and the spacesuits used today on ISS spacewalks. \u201cThe goal is to take the foundations that NASA laid with the xEMU in partnership with industry and evolve that technology, and create a suit that is compatible with the entire spectrum of crew members,\u201d said Dan Burbank, senior technical fellow at Collins. Both Burbank, a former astronaut, and Suffredini, a former NASA ISS program manager, emphasized their commitment to meeting NASA\u2019s extensive requirements for the suits, including being compatible with astronauts ranging in height from the 5th percentile woman to the 95th percentile man. However, the companies provided few technical details about their suit designs, and NASA did not even have illustrations of the winning designs to show, electing instead to release an illustration of two moonwalking astronauts wearing suits not necessarily associated with either company. Collins did later release several illustrations of its proposed suit as well as images of that design being testing in a lab. The total value of the xEVAS contracts is $3.5 billion through 2034, a figure that assumes all task orders are exercised. NASA officials at the briefing declined to break out that total between the two companies, stating that information will instead be in the source selection statement for the procurement, expected to be released publicly in late June. In many other commercial procurements, NASA has released the value of individual awards to companies. NASA spokesperson Rebecca Wickes later told SpaceNews that the individual contract values will not be published in the source selection statement. Instead, that document will list the percentage difference in the prices compared to other bidders, \u201cWe guaranteed them an amount to make sure we could get them going and they had skin in the game, and we\u2019re going to be careful to protect that,\u201d said Mark Wiese of NASA, who chaired the source selection board for the xEVAS competition. He did not disclose those guaranteed amounts. \u201cNASA will protect the exact amounts of contract guaranteed minimums and/or individual task order award amounts due to the proprietary nature of the commercial solutions while also protecting the ongoing competitive nature of this contract,\u201d Wickes said. NASA said in the statement that each company \u201chas invested a significant amount of its own money\u201d into development, but did not disclose those amounts. Burbank said that since he focused on the technical side of spacesuit development, he did not know how much the company had spent. Recent work for the xEVAS contract, he said, \u201cis just the latest version of continual investment in internal R&D.\u201d Suffredini said that Axiom\u2019s suit development was entirely internally funded. \u201cNow you have to go figure out what that is,\u201d he said. Both companies said they expected to have spacesuits ready for testing on the ISS and for the Artemis 3 mission by the mid-2020s, but another company plans to test its own spacesuit in orbit before then. As part of  the Polaris Program announced in February  and funded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, SpaceX is developing a version of its Crew Dragon pressure suit that can be used for spacewalks. That suit will be tested on the Polaris Dawn mission scheduled for later this year.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-axiom-space-and-collins-aerospace-for-spacesuit-contracts/"}, "47": {"title": "Pentagon: It\u2019s up to SpaceX to decide what to do about Starlink in Ukraine", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Pentagon press secretary Brig.

Ryder\u2019s comments follow a  series of tweets and news reports  over the weekend about the possibility that SpaceX could cut off Starlink communications services in Ukraine unless the U.S. government agrees to foot the bill.  After arguing that providing Starlink internet service in Ukraine was becoming too expensive for SpaceX and the government should help, Musk made an abrupt about-face on Monday,  tweeting  that \u201cSpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding.\u201d Musk said 25,300 terminals were sent to Ukraine but only 10,630 are paying for service.

The Orion spacecraft fired the main engine in its European Service Module at 4:52 p.m. Eastern for 88 seconds. The maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by about 110 meters per second, placing the spacecraft into a distant retrograde orbit (DRO) around the moon. The use of DRO is unique to Artemis 1. The Artemis 2 mission will fly a free return trajectory around the moon, while Artemis 3 and later missions will go into a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the moon, which will also be used by the lunar Gateway. NASA chose DRO for this mission since it is a stable orbit that enables testing of the spacecraft without requiring much fuel to maintain the orbit. Orion, though, will not remain in DRO for long. The spacecraft will perform a maneuver Dec. 1 to depart DRO, heading back towards the moon. The spacecraft will conduct another burn during a lunar flyby Dec. 5 to put the spacecraft on track for a reentry Dec. 11, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. Since its Nov. 16 launch, the Artemis 1 mission has gone well, with only a few minor issues. \u201cIn terms of overall systems failures, we haven\u2019t seen a single thing on the rocket or on the spacecraft that would have caused us to question our reliability or our redundancy,\u201d Mike Sarafin, NASA Artemis 1 mission manager, said at the most recent briefing about the mission Nov. 21. At the time of that briefing, NASA said it was looking at two issues with the spacecraft, one involving the spacecraft\u2019s star trackers and what Sarafin called \u201cfunny indications\u201d on the power system on the service module, where one of eight units used to distribute power opened without being commanded to do so. Neither issue, he said, were \u201chard concerns or hard constraints\u201d on the mission. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully understand what the system and the flight hardware is telling us, but we\u2019ve got ample redundancy and we are recovering from these \u2018funnies\u2019 that we see,\u201d he said.  On Nov. 23, NASA reported that it lost communications with Orion unexpectedly for 47 minutes starting at 1:09 a.m. Eastern. The loss of signal took place during one of a regular series of reconfigurations of the link between Orion and the Deep Space Network. It was unclear if the problem was with Orion or ground stations, and NASA has not provided an update on the issue since first reporting the glitch. Sarafin also said at that Nov. 21 briefing that the Space Launch System rocket that launched Orion met or exceeded requirements. \u201cThe results were eye-watering,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was either on predict or off by less than 1%.\u201d Engineers are also reviewing the status of the mobile launch platform, which sustained some damage from the launch, including having its elevator blast doors blown off and damage to the platform\u2019s deck. \u201cThe mobile launcher has a little bit of damage to it, but it will be ready to fly the crewed launch on Artemis 2,\u201d he said.

In a presentation at the Small Satellite Conference Aug. 11, Carlos Niederstrasser of Northrop Grumman discussed  the latest version of an annual survey of the small launch vehicle industry , focused on vehicles capable of placing up to 1,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit and available commercially. The survey now includes 166 launch vehicle projects, far higher than the 31 the same survey identified in 2015. However, growth in the number of those vehicles is now slowing. \u201cThere is no longer the crazy growth we were seeing back in \u201916 or \u201917,\u201d he said. In addition, the number of systems that have gone defunct for technical, financial or other reasons has grown. \u201cWe are definitely seeing significant attrition. That should surprise no one.\u201d There are 11 operational small launch vehicles, defined as those that have made at least one successful flight with more scheduled. However, that list includes Astra\u2019s Rocket 3.3,  which the company announced Aug. 4 that it was discontinuing  to focus on development of its larger Rocket 4. The other operational vehicles include Northrop Grumman\u2019s Minotaur 1 and Pegasus XL, Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron, Virgin Orbit\u2019s Launcher One and six Chinese vehicles: Ceres-1, Hyperbola-1, Jielong 1, Kuaizhou-1A, Kaituozhe-2 and Long March 11. \u201cThe impressive thing is that we\u2019re seeing slow but steady growth in the number of operational systems,\u201d he said. Several more vehicles are expected to make their debuts in the next two years, including vehicles by ABL Space Systems and Relativity Space that are slightly larger than the upper limit of launch vehicles included in this survey. Even as new vehicles emerge, questions remain about how much demand there will be for them. One of the most successful small launch vehicles, Electron, has flown more than 20 times but its launch rate has lagged company predictions. Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said  in a recent interview  that the company\u2019s launch rate is \u201c100% driven\u201d by market demand. In a conference keynote Aug. 8, Beck mentioned that customer readiness was an ongoing challenge. \u201cLaunch cadence is really governed by our customers\u2019 readiness,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhen I think about our launch manifest, it feels like a game of Whac-A-Mole,\u201d he said, moving customers around based on their shifting schedules. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t do that, our launch cadence would be even less. The number one driver for us at this point is customer readiness.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still far away from seeing the demand that will drive the once-a-week launches that many of these companies are hoping to see in the future,\u201d Niederstrasser said. \u201cThat, of course, is the question for the smallsat community: are small launches really a viable way of having a steady access to space or will things like rideshare continue to dominate?\u201d While those issues may have slowed growth of the industry, it has not stopped it.

If a June 17 screening near the NASA Ames Research Center is any guide, \u201cAsteroid Hunters\u201d achieves its goal of underscoring the threat asteroids pose and the opportunity to deflect a dangerous one headed toward Earth. At the film\u2019s conclusion, an audience largely comprised of people from NASA Ames and related organizations discussed ongoing efforts to search for near-Earth objects (NEOs), asteroids or comets within about 45 million kilometers of Earth\u2019s orbit. Mainly, they expressed concern for the fate of NASA\u2019s NEO Surveyor space telescope. NASA\u2019s 2023 budget proposal released in March called for slashing the NEO Surveyor space telescope budget from about $143 million in 2022 to less than $40 million in 2023. The budget plan, which would delay the space telescope\u2019s launch two years to 2028, is opposed by the National Space Society and the Planetary Society. \u201cWe urge the committee to restore funding and augment NASA\u2019s budget to provide at least $170 million to NEO Surveyor in FY 2023,\u201d the space outreach organizations said in a June 16 letter to U.S. House and Senate Appropriations Committees. NEO Surveyor \u201cis the fastest method to satisfy the congressional mandate to detect 90% of NEOs 140 meters and larger. Absent NEO Surveyor, NASA will not achieve the congressional detection mandate for another 30 years.\u201d Congress directed NASA in 2005 to identify 90 percent of an estimated 25,000 NEOs measuring 140 meters in diameter or larger by the end of 2020 and to analyze ways of diverting threatening ones. Eighteen months past the deadline, fewer than half of those NEOs have been identified. Experts anticipate swift progress in the coming decade, though, based on the expected contributions of NEO Surveyor and the Rubin Observatory, formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The Rubin Observatory, being built on a mountaintop in Chile, \u201cwill observe about 5,000 asteroids in a single image, and hundreds of thousands each night,\u201d said Ed Lu, former NASA astronaut and executive director of the virtual Asteroid Institute at B612. \u201cIt will be the big dog, absolutely the most powerful machine ever built for tracking asteroids.\u201d Telescopes built to track asteroids gather multiple images of the same area every night. The Asteroid Institute and the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology are developing computational tools to detect NEOs in other types of astronomical imagery, as long as they provide five to six views of an area within 15 to 30 days. An algorithm called Tracklet-less Heliocentric Orbit Recovery, running on Google Cloud, helped astronomers discover 104 main-belt asteroids in a search of the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory digital archives. An upcoming search of NASA\u2019s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data will likely detect thousands. \u201cWe want to apply the technique to the LSST data stream, but we need to practice on these existing datasets,\u201d Lu said. Even with powerful computational tools, NASA can\u2019t reach the goal of detecting 90 percent of the 140-meter NEOs anytime soon without a space-based telescope. \u201cFinding more than 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 140 meters in diameter is a difficult problem because the objects are far away and spread all over the sky, but Rubin and NEO Surveyor together will get the job done,\u201d Amy Mainzer, NEO Surveyor principal investigator and a University of Arizona planetary sciences professor, said by email. \u201cRubin Observatory uses visible wavelengths and is therefore sensitive to objects with more reflective surfaces, and it searches the night sky. NEO Surveyor operates at thermal infrared wavelengths and is therefore very sensitive to dark objects; it searches the near-Sun regions of the sky, thus allowing it to find objects with the most Earth-like (and therefore potentially hazardous) orbits.\u201d From its orbit near Sun-Earth Lagrange point 1, NEO Surveyor also will provide data on NEO sizes, \u201cwhich is important for figuring out which ones are capable of causing severe damage,\u201d Mainzer said. \u201cGiven the stakes, and just like monitoring for other types of natural disasters, it\u2019s critical that we have complete coverage.\u201d A 140-meter asteroid hitting Earth would release hundreds of megatons of energy. \u201cThere\u2019s never been an explosion of a nuclear weapon anywhere close to that,\u201d Lu said. (For comparison, the 40- to 60-meter asteroid that flattened an area the size of the Los Angeles basin near Siberia\u2019s Tunguska River in 1908 released an estimated 10 to 15 megatons.) The planetary sciences decadal survey, published in April by a National Academies committee, supported \u201cthe development, timely launch, and subsequent operation of the NEO Surveyor\u201d and Double Asteroid Redirection Test. In September, NASA\u2019s DART spacecraft is scheduled to collide with Dimorphos, a moon orbiting near-Earth asteroid Didymos, demonstrating a technique for deflecting an asteroid\u2019s trajectory. The timing is not yet clear for NEO Surveyor, which \u201cis extremely important and needs to happen,\u201d said Philip Christensen, an Arizona State University geological sciences professor and co-chair of the planetary sciences decadal survey, Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032. NASA recommended delaying NEO Surveyor to boost funding for Mars Sample Return and Europa Clipper. Compared with the $7 billion Mars Sample Return and $5 billion Europa Clipper, NEO Surveyor is a small mission. NASA planned to spend about $811 million on NEO Surveyor from 2022 to 2026 before the President\u2019s budget called for a delay. \u201cThe more you delay a project like this, the more it\u2019s going to cost,\u201d said Lindley Johnson, NASA planetary defense officer. Plus, NASA will need at least three to five years, and preferably 10, to take action if astronomers discover a large asteroid likely to strike Earth, Johnson said. \u201cAlthough a significant impact to the Earth is of course a very rare event, we don\u2019t know when the next one might be, and NEO Surveyor is designed to find out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe earlier we find it, the more time we have to react and the more options that are viable to deal with it.\u201d Congress will ultimately determine NEO Surveyor\u2019s fate. In budget documents released last year, NASA anticipated spending $170 million on the space telescope in 2023. House Appropriators included $94.9 million for NEO Surveyor in the 2023 budget and directed NASA to provide a timeline for launching the telescope before 2028. Philip Groves, \u201cAsteroid Hunters\u201d writer and producer, hopes the film spurs congressional support of NEO Surveyor and other efforts to detect, assess and, if necessary, divert asteroids. Asteroid Hunters, initially released in 2020 before COVID-19 reduced attendance at IMAX theaters, is now playing in Florida at the NASA Kennedy Space Center visitor complex and in Los Angeles at the California Science Center. \u201cMy hope is to get this in front of as many members of Congress and world leaders as possible,\u201d Groves said. \u201cAn asteroid impact is the one natural disaster we can prevent.\u201d Looking ahead, the decadal survey called for \u201ca rapid-response, flyby reconnaissance mission targeted to a challenging NEO of 50 to 100 meters in diameter \u2014 which is representative of the population of objects posing the highest probability of a destructive Earth impact.\u201d Large asteroid strikes are relatively rare. \u201cIn the last century or so, the largest impact that we know about was the Tunguska event,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAn event that really grabs our attention might happen once a century or every other century on average. The situation we\u2019re in right now, though, is we don\u2019t know when the next one is going to be. But we do have the knowledge and the technology to find out.\u201d NASA also has international partners. \u201cAlthough the United States has currently the most significant program looking at this, we are working with a very large team around the world,\u201d Johnson said. The European Space Agency and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency have vigorous programs underway. In addition, dozens of countries are part of the International Asteroid Warning Network, a United Nations-endorsed forum focused on helping government agencies analyze potential impacts and mitigate their consequences. \u201cThere are very significant efforts to come to an understanding on the best way to respond to this worldwide hazard,\u201d Johnson said. Aside from the threat, Lu sees creating a detailed map of the solar system as an opportunity. \u201cWhat did all the great powers in the 1500s spend their treasures on? Mapping the world,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe\u2019re on that cusp right now of opening up space, and we will need a map of where things are in the solar system. With 99% of the Tunguska-size asteroids in our solar system currently untracked, we have a very incomplete map right now.\u201d This article originally appeared in the July 2022 issue of SpaceNews magazine.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/mapping-the-sky-finding-asteroids-requires-a-combination-of-tools/"}, "51": {"title": "Blue Canyon Technologies to build Tomorrow.io microwave satellites", "content": "LOGAN, Utah \u2014 Blue Canyon Technologies won its largest constellation order to date, a contract with weather technology company Tomorrow.io.

The European Space Agency\u2019s major contribution to the mission, scheduled to launch as soon as Aug. 29, is the service module for the Orion spacecraft, called the ESM. That module, based on the Automated Transfer Vehicle cargo spacecraft ESA developed for space station resupply, provides power, propulsion, life support and other services for Orion. \u201cWith this Artemis mission, Europe is going to the moon. That is quite historic,\u201d Josef Aschbacher, director general of ESA, said at an Aug. 23 media briefing. \u201cThe fact that NASA entrusts ESA to be on the critical path is huge,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe partnership with NASA has been strong for decades, but with Artemis it will really reach a new level.\u201d Development of the ESM, including production of the module flying on Artemis 1, cost ESA about 650 million euros ($650 million), said David Parker, ESA\u2019s director for human and robotic exploration. The overall cost of the program, which currently includes six service modules, is about 2.1 billion euros, reflecting lower per-unit costs as the module moves into regular production. \u201cWe are entering into a serial production mode,\u201d said Jean-Marc Nasr, executive vice president of space systems at Airbus, the prime contractor for the ESM, with the ability to work on three modules simultaneously. \u201cWe will deliver one ESM per year and we are extremely proud of being able to do that with all our partners in Europe.\u201d In exchange for the service modules, ESA will receive three seats on future Artemis missions. \u201cWe have not made, together with NASA, the final decision which missions those ESA astronauts will fly on,\u201d Parker said. Two of those seats, he said, would likely be on Artemis 4 and 5, missions that will deliver ESA-developed components for the lunar Gateway. Aschbacher said he hoped the third seat would allow a European astronaut to walk on the moon. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking NASA very clearly is that Europe wishes to have a European astronaut footprint on the moon before the end of this decade.\u201d Those discussions, he said, will depend on both the outcome of Artemis 1 as well as the next ESA ministerial council meeting in November, where member states will fund ESA programs for the next three years. Aschbacher said ESA will request about 1.1 billion euros to continue work on ESM production and Gateway elements, part of an overall exploration package worth about three billion euros. ESA is hoping a successful Artemis 1 mission can build support for broader exploration plans. One initiative the agency is seeking funding for is a large cargo lander that can support later Artemis missions. \u201cWe hope on our side that these so-called \u2018Argonaut\u2019 landers could be ESA\u2019s next contribution to European exploration history, but the ministers will decide in November,\u201d Parker said. The ESA astronauts that will fly on upcoming Artemis missions will likely be selected from the existing group of seven active astronauts, Aschbacher said. \u201cThe selection will need to be made sooner rather than later because, at some point, the training needs to start,\u201d he said, but added there was no date set yet for any announcement.

The startup expects to begin services in the United Kingdom and across North America and Northern Europe by 2025, according to a license application British telecoms regulator Ofcom published Sept. 20. These initial services would follow two launches of a total eight satellites in 2024 to highly elliptical orbit (HEO). Phoenix, Arizona-based Mangata announced plans last year for a research and development center in Edinburgh, Scotland, to develop its technologies, although the startup has not said who will build or launch its satellites.  Plans for the center followed an investment of about $4 million from Scotland\u2019s national economic development agency. Mangata ultimately plans to deploy 224 satellites in HEO and 567 in medium Earth orbit to provide services in fixed and mobility markets, including cellular backhaul and aviation. The startup aims to connect these satellites to phased array antennas smaller than one meter in diameter, and parabolic reflectors larger than one meter, depending on the application. User terminals less than one meter in diameter would be capable of 50-500 megabits per second (Mbps) speeds, according to Mangata, while larger terminals would serve \u201ccapacities 500 Mbps and greater.\u201d Mangata\u2019s network would use Ka-band spectrum for both its terminals and gateways.

The first mission under their agreement is slated for no sooner than November 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon 9, which will launch D-Orbit\u2019s ION Satellite Carrier with four Astrocast satellites onboard. Each satellite in this batch is 3U, or the size of three cubesats, and will be dropped off at a 500-600-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) to improve coverage for Astrocast\u2019s internet of things (IoT) constellation. D-Orbit plans to launch another batch of six 6U satellites for Astrocast in 2023 and 10 more in 2024 to complete the launch agreement. Astrocast currently has 12 3U satellites, including two test spacecraft, and aims to expand its network to 20 satellites before the end of 2022.  In addition to D-Orbit, Astrocast chief financial officer Kjell Karlsen said the Swiss operator also has launch agreements with U.S. rideshare provider Spaceflight this year. Astrocast plans to grow the constellation to 40 satellites in 2023 and to operate 100 of them by 2025. To help fund this expansion, Astrocast \u2014 which already trades as a public company on Norway\u2019s Euronext Growth Oslo stock market \u2014 is looking to raise 60-80 million euros ($64-86 million) by listing shares on the Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market.

In May, Astrocast said it plans to issue new shares to buy Dutch connectivity solutions provider Hiber, which agreed to invest around $11 million in Astrocast\u2019s second stock market as part of the acquisition. Karlsen said that the acquisition is contingent on Astrocast\u2019s secondary stock market listing in France, \u201cbut we have full confidence that we will meet it and close during 2022.\u201d Fabien Jordan, Astrocast\u2019s CEO, said in a statement: \u201cIt is important for European space companies to work together to find solutions that increase the competitiveness of European space, and we believe that working with D-Orbit enables this for Astrocast,\u201d Astrocast CEO and co-founder Fabien Jordan said.

With momentum from these operations, players in this industry are hoping to grow their business selling not just imagery but also analytics products that draw trends and insights from raw data.  The main customer for these services is the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, which last year announced a  $29 million procurement  of data analytics services over five years, and intends to increase buys as companies come up with new products, said David Gauthier, director of NGA\u2019s Commercial and Business Operations Group, The agency traditionally has relied on its own analysts to draw insights from imagery. But NGA has a growing appetite for new types of analytics services offered by the private sector, Gauthier said Sept. 15 at the Intelligence & National Security Summit held at National Harbor, Maryland. Of interest are monitoring services performed by small satellites that make repeated image captures at set intervals. The frequent, automated collections \u2014 and the analysis done with artificial intelligence and machine learning software \u2014 help track change and identify trends.  The industry can do this at a fast pace, Gauthier said. \u201cIt reduces the latency for us, it reduces the barriers to operational use and integration into our workflows.\u201d Gauthier said NGA is using commercial services, for example, to monitor global economic trends. \u201cWe\u2019re buying automated detections that tell us things about infrastructure, roads, rails, building damage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re buying automated detection to tell us about objects, cars, ships and aircraft.\u201d  The data provides insights on activities that have national security and economic implications, such as illegal fishing, GPS interference or the flow of methane gas, he said.  Earth monitoring and satellite imaging company BlackSky has won some of NGA\u2019s recent contracts for economic monitoring. The company received a total of $13.8 million of orders over the past year, BlackSky said Sept. 19. \u201cThese awards underscore the growing demand for commercial real-time, AI-driven monitoring services that reveal economic activity at manufacturing hubs, major maritime ports and airports around the world,\u201d BlackSky said in a statement.  Competitive advantage Government and commercially owned spy satellites are proliferating and the United States increasingly will face tough competition in this area, said Frank Garcia, professional staff member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. This should put pressure on the U.S. intelligence community to tap the commercial market in order to gain a competitive advantage, Garcia said Sept. 15 at the INSS symposium. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, he added, are concerned that the U.S. government is not doing enough to incentivize private investment in this sector of the industry.  The House and Senate intelligence committees asked the Government Accountability Office to dig into these questions.  The GAO in a report  earlier this month concluded that \u201cactions are needed to better use commercial satellite imagery and analytics.\u201d One of the takeaways from GAO\u2019s report, said Garcia, is that there\u2019s a need for an acquisition organization to work with industry to \u201cdevelop a next generation of capabilities that is going to benefit both commercial applications, government intelligence collection and combat support.\u201d Garcia said one of the challenges is the procurement bureaucracy, as the intelligence community has divided responsibilities for acquisition. The National Reconnaissance Office operates the nation\u2019s spy satellites and is in charge of buying commercial imagery, while NGA is responsible for analytics products and services. \u201cThat\u2019s a tension that in my mind isn\u2019t fully resolved,\u201d he said.  The NRO in May  awarded 10-year contracts  to Maxar Technologies, BlackSky and Planet Labs to supply imagery. This creates \u201csome stability,\u201d Garcia said. However, he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be locked in for so long and miss out on opportunities that may arise very quickly \u2026 and miss the ability to onboard new entrants as innovations keep coming.\u201d On Capitol Hill, he said, members \u201cthink it is really vital for us to continue investing. And yet when the budgets come in, we still see some level of under investment, which is kind of disappointing.\u201d He suggested the government should share with the industry a forward-looking spending plan for commercial imagery and analytics services, which would likely spur private investment, said Garcia. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage the administration to lay that out.\u201d While the NRO is a major buyer of electro-optical imagery, agencies have not yet leveraged the new types of commercial satellite data \u2013 such as synthetic aperture radar, radio-frequency mapping and hyperspectral imagery \u2014 where the commercial market isn\u2019t fully baked, said Garcia. HawkEye 360, a commercial provider of space-based radio frequency data and analytics, is one of the newer entrants that has seen  growing demand for its services  during the Ukraine war and is looking for longer term, steady contracts.  James Doggett, vice president of mission assurance at HawkEye 360, said the U.S. government has made it clear it wants to work with commercial suppliers but does not want to be the anchor customer, which puts pressure on companies to seek business elsewhere.  For newer companies that don\u2019t have multi-year contracts, when government demand goes down, \u201cit can be existential,\u201d Doggett said.  Lifelines are sought in the export market, he said, but companies need help from the U.S. government to navigate the interagency process to get export licenses. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a key area where the government can act as a partner.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/satellite-imaging-companies-look-for-growth-in-data-analytics/"}, "56": {"title": "Department of Homeland Security publishes space policy", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has published an updated space policy that emphasizes its roles in cybersecurity and resilience. The  policy , less than three pages long, was signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas April 14. It was not published on the department\u2019s website, though, for more than two months. \u201cWhile America continues to grow its commercial space opportunities, our adversaries will also seek to disrupt the advantages the space economy will bring,\u201d the document states. \u201cThe Department must therefore support America\u2019s expanding space ecosystem by recognizing its importance to the security of the homeland and through a DHS Space Policy that defines and updates DHS\u2019s role in this important domain.\u201d The policy identifies three specific roles for the department in space. One is to protect both commercial and government space-based systems and their supply chains from threats, particularly cyberattacks. \u201cDHS will advocate for the incorporation of cybersecurity principles for all phases of space systems design, development, acquisition, deployment, and operation across the industry,\u201d the document states. That includes continued implementation of  Space Policy Directive 5, a 2020 policy for cybersecurity of space systems . The second element of the policy is devoted to resilience \u201cto minimize the impact of any natural or human-made disruptions on the homeland and to DHS mission execution.\u201d That effort includes exercises to test how the department and others would respond to the loss of critical space systems. The third element of the policy is creating contingency plans for operating in a \u201cdegraded\u201d space environment. \u201cIn addition to impacts of space weather and other natural causes, DHS must prepare for the potential that heightened tensions or adversarial activities in space may lead to impacts upon domestic space assets,\u201d the document states. The department will develop plans that include \u201cpotential vulnerabilities, likely targets, and mitigation measures that may be unique to adversarial military actions in the space domain.\u201d The policy does not offer details on how DHS will implement those elements of the policy, such as timetables or assignments of responsibility.  The preamble of the policy suggests other roles for DHS in space, particularly in coordinating impacts of space launches on maritime traffic. \u201cThe commercial space industry increasingly relies on the maritime domain for cost-effective launch and recovery of commercial rockets to support its business model in ways that impact traditional maritime stakeholders and requires DHS to develop new maritime safety and security priorities,\u201d it states. The policy doesn\u2019t elaborate on those priorities, but SpaceX uses droneships as landing platforms for its boosters. Launches by SpaceX and others can create conflicts with maritime traffic at places like Port Canaveral, Florida, including an incident in January where SpaceX scrubbed a launch when a cruise ship entered restricted waters. The U.S. Coast Guard, part of DHS, has been working to refine those restriction zones and improve communication of them to ships. While DHS did not publish the space policy until June, a department official mentioned it in April in  an interview for a Space & Satellite Professionals International (SSPI) podcast . The department did not respond to questions about the policy in the weeks after the publication of the podcast. \u201cI think this is a really important moment for DHS because it is unifying the DHS approach to space,\u201d said Nick Reese, deputy director for emerging technology policy at the department, in the podcast. The department has not traditionally been involved in space, he noted, \u201cso what DHS has had to do is really take a deliberate approach and study what it could do in space, what its role is and how it be value-added and not cover territory that others are covering.\u201d The policy was developed through an interagency process coordinated by the National Space Council, he said.

Redwire and its heritage companies did not, and that started 18 months of discussions with Sodern on a manufacturing partnership. Under the agreement, Redwire will make a star tracker called Eagle Eye based on Sodern\u2019s Hydra. Manufacturing of Eagle Eye will start in the \u201cnear term,\u201d he said once a production line is set up at a Redwire facility in Massachusetts. \u201cWe already have customers who are very interested in it,\u201d he noted, although Redwire did not take any orders in advance of signing the agreement.

The policy was a departure from strict management in the founders\u2019 previous jobs. Plus, they thought it would give them a competitive advantage. \u201cWe were a startup, and we needed to attract the talent against the big guys,\u201d said Evona co-founder Tom Kelly. \u201cSo, we said, \u2018If you want to work from a beach in Spain, you have that flexibility.\u2019\u201d In 2018, remote work was not the norm for jobs outside the tech sector. Space companies employed remote software engineers and data analysts, but most people reported to offices, laboratories, factories or facilities designed to safeguard classified information. \u201cIt required a catalyst like a global pandemic to prove across many different job functions and industries that it was possible to work remote and do it in a productive way,\u201d said Justus Kilian, Space Capital and Space Talent founder. \u201cThat experiment has proven that many jobs, not all, but many jobs can operate in a remote way.\u201d Now, there are many remote jobs in the space sector. Only 14 percent of the companies Evona works with require candidates to be on-site for more than three days a week to perform sales and operations jobs. For software and tech roles, 26 percent of the companies expect employees to spend a majority of the week on-site. Hardware and infrastructure work still requires people to show up in person for 92 percent of the companies Evona supports. \u201cEven the roles that require the employee to be on-site for the majority of the week are now increasingly offering some level of flexibility and autonomy to their staff,\u201d said Adele Fox, Evona\u2019s marketing director. \u201cVery few seem to be demanding that their employees are onsite 100 percent of the working week, even when working with specialist tools.\u201d MIXED REACTIONS Some space company leaders are embracing the trend toward remote work. Others caution against it. In any case, the pandemic has changed the calculus for current and prospective employees. After working from home for months or even years during the pandemic, some people realize how much they enjoy working alongside colleagues, while others now resist the idea of commuting or following rigid work schedules. Employers need to understand \u201cthis remote work shift\u201d and figure out how to stay competitive, Killian said. Earth-imaging company Satellogic had a globally distributed workforce before the pandemic, which allowed the company to shift quickly to remote operations. Remote operations \u201chelps increase the talent pool,\u201d said Emiliano Kargieman, Satellogic CEO and co-founder. Satellogic employees still work side-by-side building satellites, and the company has retained offices because \u201cnot everyone has a quiet room in the house where they can work,\u201d Kargieman said. Istvan Lorinc, Morpheus Space cofounder and president, is not a fan of remote work. \u201cThat was a solution for a state of emergency and not a permanent good thing,\u201d Lorinc said. \u201cImagine how much experience and knowledge is not being transferred because of remote work. In time, if this continues, the quality of work will decline.\u201d Most companies have a mix of remote and on-site work. Since Novawurks was founded in 2011, people who needed to work outside the office have done so. \u201cOf course, when they need to touch hardware, they come in,\u201d said Talbot Jaeger, Novawurks founder and chief technology officer. Bill Crandall, Novawurks business development vice president, added, \u201cWe\u2019ve had people that wanted to move, and we said, \u2018Don\u2019t quit. We\u2019ll send a spacecraft building block with you.\u2019\u201d AAC Clyde Space performs more work remotely than it did before the pandemic. \u201cOf course, we have eight satellites in the cleanroom, and someone has to actually build them,\u201d said Luis Gomes, AAC Clyde Space CEO. \u201cSome tasks have to be done in the facility. You can\u2019t hire a civil engineer from South America to work remotely. Design engineer? Yes. And we have done that.\u201d Raytheon Intelligence & Space has adopted three different working styles: remote, hybrid and on-site. Remote work can be performed anywhere in the United States. Hybrid jobs require employees to spend 50 percent of their time at a company facility. Jobs where employees spend 100 percent of their time on-site are often related to classified government work. \u201cHardware being built, especially classified hardware being built, most of that is an on-site activity,\u201d said Matt Magana, Raytheon Space Systems vice president. \u201cThen, there is a lot of classified development work. We\u2019ve done a lot to separate classified and unclassified to allow us to build a more flexible workforce because I can\u2019t ask somebody to come into a classified area and sit in there for eight hours a day, seven days a week. The environment has changed now.\u201d CHANGING ENVIRONMENT Space industry recruiters have front-row seats to observe changes in space sector employment. Early in the pandemic, many satellite and rocket manufacturers, as well as suppliers, were designated as critical infrastructure. \u201cThat forced companies to differentiate who is required to be on premise versus who is providing some sort of support and can work remote,\u201d Kilian said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a continuation of that. It\u2019s hard to compete in a world where people have seen the benefits of working from home and not having to commute. To pull that back is very challenging.\u201d Fox agrees.\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly from candidates is because they\u2019ve been working remote, because they can see their life-work balance split is better, that\u2019s what they are demanding,\u201d Fox said. \u201cCompanies that say to them you are 100 percent on-site are going to struggle to compete in a marketplace where there aren\u2019t enough qualified people to fill the roles that we have in the space sector as it is.\u201d Evona encourages space companies to offer workers flexibility where possible. Jobs that require people to work on-site can \u201chave drastically shortened core hours and let people start later,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIf you let people take their kids to school and pick their kids up from school, I can promise you will get 100 times more out from those people because you\u2019re supporting them and you\u2019re supporting their families.\u201d For employers who worry people offsite will not be as productive, Kelly has seen the opposite. \u201cAs long as you hire the right people with the right motivations and allow them to work in their way, the results go through the roof,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe are pushing this message as much as we can to our clients. There is certainly still a resistance, but it\u2019s a lot better since the pandemic.\u201d Flexible work policies have helped Evona retain workers, Kelly said. The company has an annual staff turnover rate of six percent, compared to the United Kingdom\u2019s recruitment industry average of around 40 percent. TIME TOGETHER Despite the trend toward remote work, many employers would rather interact with employees face-to-face. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an issue with remote work, but we do love to get together,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cWe have a lot of fun together.\u201d In addition, there are times when remote work isn\u2019t advantageous. Leaders of early-stage startups, for instance, often work closely together. \u201cThere is a lot of value to having close proximity to your co-founders,\u201d Kilian said. \u201cYou can make decisions very quickly [and] be very action-oriented.\u201d Even later-stage companies are planning retreats and other ways to bring employees together. After a couple of years of extensive remote operations, Satellogic is now \u201ctrying to push in the opposite direction and get employees together physically as much as we can,\u201d Kargieman said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a portion of being in the flesh, in the same room that just can\u2019t be fully replaced by remote work.\u201d This article originally appeared in the September 2022 issue of SpaceNews magazine.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/remote-working-trend/"}, "60": {"title": "FCC considers new rules for emerging space capabilities", "content": "LOGAN, Utah \u2014 An inquiry into updating rules around space debris and emerging on-orbit services seeks to position the U.S. as a leader in an emerging space economy. The Federal Communications Commission voted Aug. 5 to explore the economic potential and policy questions relating to in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing capabilities (ISAM). \u201cWe believe the new space age needs new rules,\u201d FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement, because \u201cthe regulatory frameworks we rely on to shape space policy were largely built for another era.\u201d Rosenworcel said ISAM capabilities can lead to the development of new ways to clear up orbital debris that, if left unaddressed, will constrain the future space economy.  The move will, for the first time, \u201ccreate a record of what is needed to support and enable the new space economy before the FCC,\u201d said Laura Cummings, regulatory affairs counsel for debris-removal startup Astroscale\u2019s U.S. division. \u201cThis includes consideration of spectrum use by novel missions, application processing and licensing procedures to facilitate commercial activity, and orbital debris considerations for unprecedented operations,\u201d Cummings said at the Small Satellite Conference here.

Commercial satellites have crossed the Rubicon and companies need to figure out how they will cope with the prospect of intentional or accidental attacks during international conflicts, says  a new report  by Aerospace Corp.   Typically only companies that provide direct services to the U.S. military would consider security issues to be relevant to day-to-day commercial operations, but that is changing, the report says.  \u201cIn crises and conflicts, commercial space actors risk getting caught in the middle of a tense and escalatory environment,\u201d writes Robin Dickey, space policy and strategy analyst at Aerospace\u2019s Center for Space Policy and Strategy, An attack could occur \u201ceither because a commercial system is misidentified as a military system or because that commercial system is suspected of acting aggressively or threateningly,\u201d the report says. Because of these risks, Dickey argues, commercial space companies should consider getting directly or indirectly involved in international efforts to develop norms of behavior in space, even though traditionally only governments and the United Nations take the lead in space security policy discussions. Some of these norms, the report suggests, could involve the application of existing laws of armed conflict that protect civilians and their property. Other norms could be the adoption of minimum cybersecurity standards for all satellites. \u201cCommercial actors should not be left out of the discussion,\u201d the report says, and should be proactive to mitigate potential threats that could disrupt the capabilities and services they provide to customers. Major powers are \u201ctalking more explicitly about an era of militarized competition,\u201d Dickey points out. \u201cAnd commercial actors will likely have to operate in times that are not so peaceful, and commercial companies will not be exempt if conflict breaks out. In those situations, norms could help to mitigate some of the risks and threats for commercial operators.\u201d If a nation state were to blow up another nation\u2019s satellite with a missile strike during a conflict, the impact from the debris could affect commercial satellites in unpredictable ways, the report noted.  Throughout the history of war, significant harm was inflicted on civilians or their property, leading to the adoption of international norms to mitigate collateral damage. \u201cThis parallels the challenges of indiscriminate systems in space \u2014 like debris-producing anti-satellite weapons,\u201d says the report. \u201cThe destruction of a satellite in a conflict could result in the destruction of a commercial satellite on the other side of the world months or years later, a similar dynamic to the persistent threat of landmines for decades after they were deployed.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/report-industry-has-to-face-reality-that-commercial-satellites-will-be-targets-in-war/"}, "62": {"title": "TransAstra and Slooh to offer students asteroid detection tool", "content": "LOGAN, Utah \u2014  Space logistics startup TransAstronautica announced a partnership Aug. 9 with online astronomy platform Slooh to offer U.S. schools access to a global network of ground-based and space-based telescopes. \u201cWe will find moving objects in space with a partnership between education, industry and government,\u201d Joel Sercel, TransAstra founder and CEO, told  SpaceNews.  \u201cFor the first time, thousands of amateurs and kids of all stripes will be able to log on to the global network of telescopes that are optimized for finding moving bodies in space.\u201d Under the agreement, TransAstra and Slooh will work together to install TransAstra\u2019s Sutter telescopes at Slooh and TransAstra observation sites around the world.

TransAstra operates a second Sutter telescope at the Sierra Remote Observatory in California. Taken together, the observatory locations will provide students with 24-hour coverage of the night sky. \u201cThis removes an important barrier to everyone being able to get in on the new space age,\u201d said Michael Paolucci, Slooh founder and CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re all not going to be able to get up in a spaceship, and even Ph.D. astronomers battle to get time on telescopes. We\u2019re offering 24-hour access to the night sky that is not weather dependent.\u201d TransAstra, a Los Angeles startup focused on orbital logistics and space mining, developed the Sutter telescope to survey asteroid minerals. In addition to the ground-based observations, TransAstra and Slooh plan to launch a small commercial telescope within two years. \u201cOnce deployed, that telescope will be the first of its kind to allow school children and amateurs from all over the world to control a spaceborne astronomical instrument for finding moving bodies in space,\u201d according to an Aug. 9 TransAstra news release. The spaceborne telescope will serve as a demonstration for Sutter Ultra, a mission that involves \u201chundreds of inexpensive commercial telescopes fitted out with Sutter technology to be mounted on just three modest size spacecraft and flown in heliocentric space,\u201d Sercel said. \u201cOur calculations show that in the first year of operation, Sutter Ultra can find up to 300 times more asteroids than have been found in the entire history of astronomy. That\u2019s a game-changing breakthrough.\u201d TransAstra also is working with Slooh to determine how students could share credit for asteroid discoveries or name their discoveries.

All.Space announced plans Aug. 1 to begin production in late 2022 of the new terminal, which is designed to connect networks \u201cvia multiple, simultaneous links,\u201d according to the company based in Reading, England. Last year, the British company announced  successful field tests  of its flat-panel antenna, after successfully connecting to fleet operator SES\u2019s satellites in geostationary and medium Earth orbit at the same time. Recently, All.Space concluded field tests with U.S. and U.K. government agencies as well as satellite operators to demonstrate antennas that linked satellites in low-Earth, medium-Earth and geostationary orbits. Eutelsat and OneWeb recently agreed on a  plan to merge  their businesses to create a global multi-orbit satellite broadband operator. It was the latest sign that satellite communications firms are eager to establish constellations with satellites in multiple orbits. With the growing importance of nongeostationary orbit constellations and high-throughput satellites, there is a \u201cpressing need to connect satellites in different orbits,\u201d John Finney, All.Space founder and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cWe have created the next chapter for the all-important ground segment.\u201d Finney added that the introduction of the new All.Space terminals \u201cwill be a catalyst for a whole new era of communications, defined by multiple full-performance connections, power and waveform integration, computing, resource control and intelligent routing that enables a range of value-added software-defined services.\u201d At the end of the year, All.Spaceplans to begin shipping its smart terminals \u201cto a significant backlog of commercial and NATO defense customers,\u201d according to the Aug. 1 news release.

The Space Force will take over control of the Wideband Global Satcom and Defense Satellite Communications System constellations of military satellites. The  satellites  were built and launched by the U.S. Air Force but the Army controlled the payloads.  The Pentagon approved the  transfer last year  in an effort to consolidate space programs under the  new military branch , which is responsible for providing satellite-based services to DoD and allies. The Army shifted about $78 million to the Space Force\u2019s 2022 budget to cover the cost of operating five satellite operations centers and four regional support centers. About 500 military and civilian personnel will transition from the Army to the  Space Force\u2019s Delta 8  unit based at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado.  In addition to the Wideband Global Satcom the Defense Satellite Communications System, Space Delta 8 operates the Global Positioning System constellation and several communications systems, including  Advanced EHF, MILSTAR  and the Enhanced Polar System. \u201cThis transfer will mark the first time all Department of Defense military satellite communication functions have been consolidated under a single military service,\u201d the Space Force said in a news release.  Lt. Gen. Daniel Karbler, head of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said the transfer of satcom operations to the Space Force does not mean the Army is exiting the space business. In fact the Army is looking for  new ways to use space capabilities  in nontraditional ways such as for cyber warfare and information operations.  \u201cSpace is a joint team sport,\u201d Karbler said  last week at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama. The vital role of space \u201c demands integration at the tactical level,\u201d he said. \u201cNo longer will the space domain be untethered from air, sea and land components.\u201d Karbler said \u201ceach service with their unique mission sets must leverage the space domain and apply it to service-specific execution, command and control.\u201d Due to its large size, the Army is the military\u2019s largest consumer of space services, he said, \u201cand we must retain organic capabilities tailored to meet our demands, responsive to our priorities, and reflective of our culture.\u201d That said, the Army is not looking to fight turf battles with other services, Karbler added. The Army\u2019s need for its own space systems \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re just all going to circle our wagons in some service parochial way.\u201d The Army will retain its  1st Space Brigade , based at Fort Carson, Colorado.  The brigade was established in 2005 in response to the military\u2019s growing use of satellites and ground stations for combat operations. Many of its nearly 2,000 soldiers are deployed in 11 countries. During deployments, members of the brigade monitor the health of satellites in orbit, help commanders analyze data from missile missile satellites and other space-based intelligence like imagery.  According to multiple sources, the Space Force has been in talks with the Army about possibly transfering the Army\u2019s Joint Tactical Ground Stations based in Italy, South Korea, Japan and Qatar. Known as JTAGS, these units are currently part of the 1st Space Brigade. They analyze and disseminate infrared data downlinked from overhead sensors and provide early warning of ballistic missile launches.  Army\u2019s space command to develop payloads The Army Space and Missile Defense Command, based in Huntsville, in recent years has developed and launched satellites like the  Kestrel Eye ,  Gunsmoke-J  imaging spacecraft, and the  Lonestar  experiment for space-based situational awareness.  Moving forward, SMDC does not plan to build complete satellites but will develop payloads that the Space Force or other organizations will integrate on military or commercial satellite buses, said  Wheeler \u201cChip\u201d Hardy, director of space applications at SMDC\u2019s Technical Center. \u201cTo operate effectively in the space domain, we must retain organic capabilities tailored to meet Army requirements and demands,\u201d Wheeler said at the symposium. Ground forces, for example,  have particular needs  for overhead surveillance, target identification and non-GPS alternative forms of navigation. \u201cSpace capabilities tailored to unique land force requirements and just as importantly, the knowledge of those needs, do not currently reside within the Space Force,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cAs DoD\u2019s largest user of space, the Army is best positioned to define and execute Army operational space requirements.\u201d The plan for the next few years is to focus on the development of payloads and sensors, Wheeler said.   SMC could develop and demonstrate a payload on a high altitude platform such as  Zephyr  drone, or as part of a space experiment, he said. \u201cThis is our view of the future, where we can concentrate almost fully on the payload and then transition the payload technology to another agency such as the Space Force for operational effects.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-army-hands-over-satellite-operations-to-space-force-but-keeps-a-foothold-in-space/"}, "65": {"title": "X Prize Foundation studying active debris removal competition", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The X Prize Foundation is considering a prize competition focused on removal of space debris to spur technological innovation in the field. During a panel discussion at the Fourth Summit for Space Sustainability by the Secure World Foundation and the U.K. Space Agency June 23, Anousheh Ansari, chief executive of the X Prize Foundation, said her organization was studying several potential ways to run a prize to support development of active debris removal systems. That work is still in its early stages. \u201cThis one is challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished the design right now.\u201d The foundation is looking at three options for a debris removal prize. One would be to remove rocket bodies, which constitute the largest and potentially most dangerous pieces of debris in orbit. \u201cFrom an awareness perspective, it will be a good driver of conversation to change policy,\u201d she said. A second option would be a mission to remove several \u201ccubesat or larger\u201d objects. A third option would be to remove a cloud of smaller debris, which she said would be the most challenging. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to evaluate all the different aspects,\u201d she said, perhaps by combining two of the options in some way. While the design of the prize remains open, Ansari said she was convinced of the importance of having such a competition. One reason is to build awareness of the space debris problem and potential solutions beyond the space community. \u201cOne of the things we do really well at X Prize is create public awareness through competitions.\u201d A second reason is to spur technological advancements. \u201cWe never try to predict a solution or approach to solving a problem,\u201d she said, instead providing \u201cspecific, measurable objectives\u201d for teams to achieve in their preferred ways. \u201cThat leads to really novel and original approaches sometimes.\u201d A prize competition could also spur development of policies needed to enable active debris removal. \u201cThat is a grand challenge that needs to be resolved if we\u2019re going to have a robust economy around this.\u201d Ansari didn\u2019t offer a schedule for developing the prize, but said she hoped the prize would run over five years. That ruled out, she said, more ambitious efforts like not just removing debris but instead recycling it in space in some way. \u201cEveryone told us that you\u2019d have to make this a 10- to 15-year prize, not a 5-year prize,\u201d she said. However, the prize could be structured in such a way that debris is not deorbited but instead moved to a \u201cjunkyard\u201d orbit for later reuse. An active debris removal prize would be the third space-related competition by the X Prize Foundation, which has a mixed track record on past competitions. The foundation started more than 25 years ago with a $10 million prize for suborbital human spaceflight, won by Scaled Composites in 2004 with SpaceShipOne. That prize led to the formation of Virgin Galactic, which licensed that technology to develop SpaceShipTwo. However, that vehicle has yet to enter regular commercial service after lengthy delays. None of the roughly two dozen other teams that participated in that competition ever reached space. The Google Lunar X Prize offered $30 million in prizes to private lunar lander missions. However,  the prize ended in 2018 , a decade after its start, without a winner. The competition did award several small milestone prizes to teams and a  $1 million \u201cMoonshot Award\u201d to SpaceIL , which attempted to land on the moon in 2019 but crashed. Ansari noted that some teams continued their lander efforts after the prize and have won commercial and government contracts, like Astrobotic and ispace. \u201cWe consider this the best failure we had,\u201d she said. The foundation also administered the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge for terrestrial testing of lunar lander technology, sponsored by Northrop Grumman and with a prize purse from NASA\u2019s Centennial Challenges program. Armadillo Aerospace and Masten Space Systems won the prizes in 2009.

NASA announced Oct. 12 that it has scheduled the launch of the Artemis 1 mission for Nov. 14 from the Kennedy Space Center. The launch would take place during a 69-minute window that opens at 12:07 a.m. Eastern. Backup launch windows are available Nov. 16 at 1:04 a.m. Eastern and Nov. 19 at 1:45 a.m. Eastern, each two hours long. The agency said that inspections of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft after it rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building Sept. 27 found \u201cminimal work\u201d needed to prepare them for another launch attempt. That work includes repairing minor damage to the rocket\u2019s thermal protection system from earlier launch attempts and tests, as well as replacing or recharging batteries for the rocket\u2019s flight termination system. NASA expects to have the vehicle ready to roll back to Launch Complex 39B as soon as Nov. 4. NASA rolled the rocket back to the VAB to protect it from Hurricane Ian as the storm cut across Florida. That ruled out launch opportunities in late September and early October, and the rollback meant NASA could not try again during a launch period open in the latter half of October. The new launch opportunities are near the start of the following launch period. NASA is pressing ahead with those opportunities despite them being at night. Agency officials earlier suggested they preferred to launch during the day for improved tracking of the SLS on its inaugural flight, but that would have required waiting until at least Nov. 22, in the latter half of the launch period. The new launch date for Artemis 1 means it is now scheduled for launch within days of a commercial lunar lander mission. Japanese company ispace announced Oct. 12 that it plans to launch its first HAKUTO-R lander on a Falcon 9 between Nov. 9 and 15 from Cape Canaveral. The M1 lander completed testing last month at a facility in Germany and it being prepared for shipment to the launch site. The lander is carrying a variety of payloads, including a small lunar rover called Rashid developed by the United Arab Emirates. \u201cFor me this is a milestone on the road to realizing our vision, but I am already proud of our results,\u201d Takeshi Hakamada, chief executive of ispace, said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to watching the launch alongside all of our employees and those who have supported us.\u201d That schedule puts ispace ahead of two American companies also preparing lunar landers for launch. Both Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines had planned to launch their first lander missions before the end of the year, carrying payloads that included those provided by NASA though its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. However, Intuitive Machines said over the summer that the Falcon 9 launch of its IM-1 mission would slip to early 2023. Astrobotic, flying on the inaugural mission of United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan Centaur, had been holding a 2022 launch until Oct. 10, when ULA announced it was delaying the launch to the first quarter of 2023 to give Astrobotic more time to complete its lander. It was not clear that Vulcan itself would be ready to launch this year because of delays in the delivery of the BE-4 engines that power its first stage. In an Oct. 10 statement, John Thornton, chief executive of Astrobotic, said his company would release more details about its launch plans in the near future, but noted the lander has recently returned to the company\u2019s Pittsburgh headquarters after completing pressure testing of its propulsion system. \u201cWe are now proceeding with final spacecraft assembly which includes installation of the solar panel along with avionics, sensors, communications equipment and payloads, which are already tested and integrated with their corresponding decks,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Peregrine begins its journey to the Moon in early 2023, it will be an incredible accomplishment for Astrobotic, the city of Pittsburgh, and the space industry as a whole.\u201d Tokyo-based ispace is not directly a part of the CLPS program.

Speaking at the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference here Sept. 29, Diane Howard, director of commercial space policy for the National Space Council, said the council would soon publish formal notifications of those sessions to get input on both the types of space activities and how they should be supervised in order to comply with the Outer Space Treaty. \u201cI\u2019d like you to start thinking about supervision: what it would look like, what are some ways to provide meaningful supervision of the operational phase of missions that doesn\u2019t burden business models and doesn\u2019t hinder innovation,\u201d she said. One learning session, scheduled for a little more than a month from now, will invite industry to discuss their planned missions \u201cso we can better understand them and be more effective in crafting a flexible framework that can grow with them,\u201d she said.

The review, conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), was mandated by Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. A committee of experts who worked on the review for over a year released its findings Sept. 9 in a  78-page report . Congress ordered the study after Ligado Networks in 2020 was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to develop a 5G cellular service by repurposing a portion of L-band radio spectrum adjacent to that used by GPS and Iridium. The FCC\u2019s order led to a major dustup, as the Defense Department, Iridium and several industry groups  pushed to overturn  the regulatory approval arguing that Ligado\u2019s network will disrupt services that support national security, civil aviation and other sectors.  The chairman of the NASEM committee Michael McQuade, of Carnegie Mellon University, said the group looked at the technical issues regarding the FCC\u2019s spectrum allocation but was not asked to assess whether the FCC made a good or bad decision.  \u201cIt is complex, there are significant economic, legal, and regulatory issues at play that have been debated and analyzed for a very long time,\u201d McQuade said Sept. 9 on a webcast hosted by the National Academies.  On the central issue of whether Ligado\u2019s network will disrupt GPS services, the panel said most receivers will not be affected but the \u201chigh precision\u201d systems used by DoD likely will be. \u201cWe do conclude that most commercially produced general navigation timing cellular or certified GPS receivers will not experience significant harmful interference from Ligado emissions as authorized by the FCC,\u201d said McQuade.  \u201cThe receivers that are potentially most vulnerable are the high precision receivers,\u201d he said, In tests, the highest proportion of systems that experienced  \u201csignificant harmful interference were the high precision receivers.\u201d McQuade also noted that the interference issue  would be easily solved in newly designed GPS receivers \u201cthat could coexist with the authorized Ligado signals and achieve good performance.\u201d But he cautioned that replacing receivers would be unrealistic for DoD that has fielded millions of GPS-enabled pieces of equipment.  With regard to Iridium terminals, \u201cour conclusion is that the Iridium terminals will experience harmful interference on their downlink caused by Ligado user terminals operating in the Uplink 1 band,\u201d said McQuade. The interference would happen when Iridium terminals are closer than 732 meters to the Ligado emitters.  DoD, Ligado react to report In a statement, DoD said the NASEM study \u201cconfirms that Ligado\u2019s system will interfere with DoD GPS receivers, which include high-precision GPS receivers. The study also confirms that Iridium satellite communications will experience harmful interference caused by Ligado user terminals.\u201d These conclusions are \u201cconsistent with  DoD\u2019s long-standing view  that Ligado\u2019s system will interfere with critical GPS receivers and that it is impractical to mitigate the impact of that interference.\u201d As to what happens next, DoD said it \u201clooks forward to continuing to work with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, FCC and Ligado on this complex and important issue.\u201d The Commerce Department\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the interagency organization that oversees the government\u2019s spectrum policies. Ligado said in a statement it \u201cappreciates the review of the FCC\u2019s April 2020 order by the National Academies of Sciences.\u201d The company\u2019s take on the review is that it \u201cconfirms what the FCC found over two years ago. Ligado\u2019s licensed and authorized operations can co-exist with GPS.\u201d Ligado noted that only a \u201csmall percentage of very old and poorly designed GPS devices may require upgrading. Ligado, in tandem with the FCC, established a program two years ago to upgrade or replace federal equipment, and we remain ready to help any agency that comes forward with outdated devices. So far, none have.\u201d Now that the review is completed, Ligado said, \u201cit is our sincere hope the DoD and the NTIA will stop blocking Ligado\u2019s license authority and focus instead on working with Ligado to resolve potential impacts relating to all DoD systems.\u201d An industry group that has worked to overturn the FCC order, known as the Keep GPS Working Coalition, said the NASEM report validates the group\u2019s belief that the \u201cFCC essentially authorized terrestrial operations in a satellite band without adequately considering the impact Ligado\u2019s proposed operations would have on countless consumers, farmers, ranchers, pilots, boat owners, surveyors, construction companies and others.\u201d Iridium said in a statement that the study offers proof that the FCC order \u201cfailed to fully consider the risk of harmful interference posed to mission-critical satellite systems. Iridium urges the FCC to take swift action to reverse the order before Ligado starts its technical demonstrations this fall.\u201d The FCC has not yet commented on the report. In response to congressional pushback, the agency in the past  has defended its decision  to authorize Ligado\u2019s network as part of a national effort to advance 5G connectivity.  The FCC set conditions, such as requiring that Ligado network design ensures that adjacent band operations, including GPS, are protected from harmful interference. The NASEM report said mitigation measures are helpful but can\u2019t be applied unilaterally. \u201cIt has to be the result of extensive dialogue between a presumed affected party and Ligado,\u201d and those conversations presumably did not take place, said McQuade.  \u201cWe simply make the statement that without that dialogue, it is impractical to believe that the mitigation measures can work,\u201d he said. These mitigation measures also would not be practical if they\u2019re not applied \u201cat operationally relevant timescales and at reasonable cost for DoD systems.\u201d The NASEM panel, however, did not endorse the approaches used by DoD to test interference and should not be used going forward. McQuade said the committee believes that \u201csome form of cohesive policy\u201d is needed to address the rights of current spectrum users , what those rights are, how long those rights should prevail, and what the impact of equipment lifetimes are likely to be. These are debates that should be had \u201coutside of the pressure of an individual spectrum decision,\u201d he said.  The committee\u2019s work has been officially completed, McQuade said. As the government works to resolve the Ligado issue, \u201cthe committee believes that whatever process is followed, that process would be much more much more effective if the FCC and the NTIA both engaged in dialogue.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/report-ligados-wireless-network-will-interfere-with-iridium-and-some-gps-services/"}, "69": {"title": "Mangata Networks gets funds for Scottish satellite manufacturing hub", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Mangata Networks, the U.S.-based startup founded by a former OneWeb executive, said Dec. 5 it signed a $100 million financing deal to build a manufacturing facility in Scotland for its multi-orbit broadband constellation.

Tournear said it\u2019s important for the agency to get Tranche 0 satellites on orbit by March so they can be tested in military exercises next summer.  \u201cTranche 0 is our minimum viable product to do a demonstration that shows that we can get data from a satellite to a targeting cell \u2026 and that we can detect and track a hypersonic glide vehicle,\u201d Tournear said. \u201cThose are our two demonstrations that we want the warfighter to experiment with.\u201d The satellites trying to make the December launch are \u201cin integration right now, doing last minute finishing touches, putting the payloads on the satellites,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some ground software that we actually had to change.\u201d SDA reassigned the ground software development that was being done by the Naval Research Laboratory to the satellite contractors \u201cto help with the schedule,\u201d Tournear said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of margin.\u201d Tournear said there\u2019s also some risk in the schedule of L3Harris\u2019 satellites. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking daily to make sure that we get the parts delivered and the satellites built on time.\u201d The first Tranche 0 launch is SDA\u2019s main focus right now, he said. \u201cWe are all tracking this every day, almost hourly.\u201d People are used to seeing  Starlink  launches go up every month with a lot of satellites, Tournear noted. SpaceX makes it look easy \u201cbut it does take years to get this kind of model up and running and going.\u201d Tournear said his biggest worries regarding SDA\u2019s constellation are cyber attacks and supply chain issues. \u201cThose are the ones that keep me up at night,\u201d he said.  There are two main concerns about the supply chain. One is the possibility that an adversary  infiltrates the supply chain  and inserts counterfeit components.  The other is having enough resiliency in the supply chain so the government is not dependent on a single supplier, a problem that contributed to the delays in the Tranche 0 satellites. Tournear said the vendors producing  Tranche 1 satellites  for the next deployment are seeing improvements in their supply chains.

Including  $3 million raised in pre-Series A  in June 2019, Bellatrix has raised $11 million since its establishment in 2015. Investors include StartupXseed, Pavestone Capital, Mankind Pharma family office, Survam Partners and Karsemven Fund. Several angel investors and family offices joined the latest funding round, the company said in a  June 1 statement . \u201cIn the past ten years, the number of satellites in space has increased almost tenfold and based on announced private-sector missions is likely to multiply rapidly in the next ten years,\u201d the company said in the statement. \u201cIn-space propulsion systems that save costs and use more environmentally friendly technologies are increasingly relevant to the growing satellite market.\u201d The company added orbital transfer vehicles are becoming a \u201cnew means of reaching orbit on rideshare missions for micro and small satellites.\u201d Bellatrix is developing an orbital transfer vehicle based on its in-space propulsion technologies as part of its efforts to become a full-fledged space transportation technology company. In the statement, Rohan M Ganapathy, Bellatrix\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said the pre-Series A funding helped the company develop \u201cnumerous critical technologies in-house.\u201d The latest funding will help his company expand the product portfolio, hire new employees and validate its products in space. The chief executive said the company plans to complete the development and test of four home-developed thruster modules by the end of the year. The company is also planning to complete space qualification testing of its under-development orbital transfer vehicle \u201cin the coming months.\u201d While Bellatrix didn\u2019t elaborate on how the space qualification test will be performed, it\u2019s likely that the vehicle will be launched aboard a rocket developed by another Indian space startup  Skyroot Aerospace . The two companies signed a  memorandum of understanding in February 2021 , under which Bellatrix\u2019s orbital transfer vehicle is supposed to launch on a rocket that Skyroot is developing. The latter, founded in 2018 by former scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is developing a small satellite launcher named Vikram 1. It\u2019s a solid-fueled, three-stage satellite launcher designed to deliver up to 500 kilograms of payload to low Earth orbit, and 500 kilograms to sun-synchronous polar orbit, according to the company\u2019s  website .  Skyroot successfully carried out a  full-duration test of Vikram 1\u2019s third stage  in May, which lasted 108 seconds with a peak thrust of 100 kN.

Getting there will be a race against time, as most of the rockets that are under contract to launch these satellites are new vehicles that have not yet flown.  The availability of heavy-lift rockets to deploy Kuiper satellites on time is \u201ca constrained resource right now,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services said Oct. 27 at a  Washington Post Live  event.  The July 2026 deadline was set by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission  in 2020 when it approved  Amazon\u2019s request to operate an estimated $10 billion constellation of roughly 3,200 internet satellites in low Earth orbit.  Amazon in April announced it procured  83 launches  on United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan Centaur, Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn and Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 6, none of which has yet flown. Previously Amazon had  ordered nine launches  on ULA\u2019s Atlas 5, a proven vehicle that is in limited supply as ULA plans to retire it and transition to Vulcan.  Limp said the company remains confident it will meet the FCC deadline even if that requires buying launches from satellite internet archrival SpaceX. On Vulcan, New Glenn and Ariane 6, the question is not \u201cwill they fly, it\u2019s just when, it\u2019s a timing question,\u201d he said. By buying Atlas 5s, \u201cwe hedged our bets a bit.\u201d The new vehicles \u201chopefully come into place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are also other providers out there,\u201d Limp added. \u201cWe have a lot of satellites to put up into space. So we\u2019re open to contracting with anyone,\u201d including SpaceX. Amazon Kuiper is positioning to compete with SpaceX\u2019s Starlink broadband constellation but it would not rule out seeking launch services from its competitor given the tight deadline, Limp said. \u201cWe are open to talking to SpaceX. You\u2019d be crazy not to, given their track record.\u201d The Falcon 9, however, is not as large as Amazon would like it to be in order to get maximum bang for its launch buck, as Kuiper satellites are larger than Starlink\u2019s. \u201cI would say Falcon 9 is probably at the low end of the capacity that we need,\u201d Limp said. Perhaps a better option would be Falcon Heavy or the much larger Starship, which is still in development. As Starship transitions to production readiness, \u201cthat becomes a very viable candidate for us as well.\u201d There are many \u201ccool and amazing\u201d rockets flying today, he said, \u201cbut the fact of the matter is that heavy launch capacity is still pretty constrained, and I think it will be for the coming years.\u201d Race to build satellites In an effort to meet the 2026 target, Amazon is ramping up satellite production. The company on Thursday announced plans to open a 172,000-square-foot satellite production facility in Kirkland, Washington, to build as many as four satellites per day. That\u2019s in addition to the 219,000-square-foot research and development facility it already operates in Redmond, Washington.  \u201cWe have to build manufacturing capabilities that look more like consumer electronics or automobiles and less like the traditional space industry,\u201d Limp said. \u2018We\u2019re over 1,000 people now we\u2019re continuing to hire,\u201d he said.  The first two Kuiper prototype satellites are being produced in Redmond. \u201cThose should be done by the end of the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re in test right now,\u201d he said. The plan is to deliver them to ULA in early 2023 so they can fly on  Vulcan\u2019s first launch .  \u201cGiven the schedule we have in front of us,\u201d Limp said, \u201cassuming success of our prototype satellites, we\u2019re in parallel bringing up manufacturing of our production satellites so we can meet that milestone.\u201d Limp pushed back on the idea that Amazon is too far behind SpaceX to become a viable competitor.  \u201cThe headlines would have you think that this is a sports race and there\u2019s going to be one winner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are literally hundreds of millions of customers around the world that don\u2019t have access to great broadband \u2026 And I think there\u2019s plenty of room for two great constellations.\u201d He said Amazon did not greenlight billions of dollars in launch contracts until \u201cwe had a satellite on a bench that seemed to be working and we had an antenna that seemed to be working.\u201d Amazon intends to compete with  Starlink  by offering affordable terminals, Limp said. Kuiper terminals cost under $400 to produce, Limp said, but did specify what they will sell for.  \u201cThe actual dish that will connect to the satellite network has a much lower cost than anybody has seen before, including Starlink. So I think we\u2019ll have some advantages, because in the end, I think there\u2019ll be plenty of room for two constellations.\u201d The Kuiper constellation was designed to  operate in the Ka band , which resulted in larger and more expensive satellites, said Limp, \u201cbut we have more power on our bus, and the advantage for us was to be able to build a much lower cost antenna.\u201d Commercial satellites and national security Limp said Amazon is pursuing U.S. government contracts, including the  military .  \u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with a bunch of different parts of the U.S. government,\u201d he said. The company earlier this year secured a  NASA  contract for mesh networking in space.  In response to a  question on the role of commercial satellites during war, Limp said, \u201cAt Amazon, in general, it\u2019s one of our tenets that technology should be used to help national security and so to the extent that Kuiper can help, I think we\u2019re open to those discussions.\u201d It\u2019s too early to speculate on specific roles Projet Kuiper would play in support of of national security, Limp added. \u201cBut I would say from a macro level that access to broadband is part and parcel to access to information, and when you get information that is not censored, that is the path of freedom.\u201d Right now, \u201cwe\u2019re too early to be thinking about that. We\u2019ve got to get this system up and working first. But I do believe the moral high ground of having access to ground truth information is an important one for society.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/as-clock-ticks-on-amazons-constellation-buying-starship-launches-not-out-of-the-question/"}, "73": {"title": "Satellite Vu orders second satellite for tracking heat waste", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 British Earth observation startup Satellite Vu has ordered a second satellite from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

Satellite Vu said July 21 the satellite is a clone of the one it ordered last year from U.K.-based SSTL, and would double the data it can collect to identify buildings that are wasting heat and other climate change applications. The two satellites are based on SSTL\u2019s 130-kilogram DarkCarb design, which carries mid-wave infrared (MWIR) technology for capturing thermal imagery at a resolution of 3.5 meters. The first of seven planned satellites are slated to launch in the first quarter of 2023 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter rideshare mission. The satellite  was previously slated  to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022. The British startup expects its second satellite will be launched in early 2024. It did not provide a timeframe for the remaining satellites. \u201cThe procurement of another satellite is driven by market demand for more capacity to address urgent customer problems and investor confidence in the team to accelerate the execution of the company business plan,\u201d Satellite Vu founder and CEO Anthony Baker said in a statement. Satellite Vu said it has been working to de-risk the technology with funding support from the UK Space Agency\u2019s National Space Innovation Programme (NSIP).  The startup has raised \u00a320 million ($24 million) in grants and venture capital to date, including an investment  announced in March  from U.S.-based Lockheed Martin and In-Q-Tel. The full constellation would be able to measure heat coming off a building multiple times a day, according to Satellite Vu.

Redwire said Oct.3 it plans to buy QinetiQ Space, which supplies small satellites and other instruments for European end-to-end space missions, for 32 million euros ($31.4 million). It is Redwire\u2019s first acquisition in nearly a year since it bought biotechnology company  Techshot in November  \u2014   a few months after going public to raise a war chest for further deals. Created by private equity firm AE Industrial Partners in June 2020, Redwire has built up a diverse space technology business by snapping up other companies. These include space manufacturing company Made In Space and Deployable Space Systems, which develops spacecraft structures and solar arrays. Despite poor macroeconomic conditions, Redwire chair and CEO Pete Cannito said the company continues to have an appetite for acquisitions. \u201cWe are entering a multi-decade space competition with China and Russia,\u201d Cannito told  SpaceNews  via email. \u201cAs a result, despite a negative trending macro-environment across the general economy, demand for space capabilities from both US and international government participants remains strong.\u201d A challenging macroeconomic environment could also bring more distressed companies to the deal table. Redwire\u2019s strategic focus areas include orbit servicing and manufacturing, digitally engineered spacecraft, and space domain awareness. In September 2021, Redwire became a public company by merging with Genesis Park Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, to fuel further acquisitions.  However, apart from its deal for Techshot and the plan to buy QinetiQ Space, the group has been quiet on the acquisition front since listing on the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cInorganic growth has always been a part of the Redwire strategy,\u201d  Cannito said. \u201cWe did take time to stop to go public before moving on to our next major acquisition.\u201d Following a surge of investments in the broader space industry over the last few years, investors have  recently raised concerns  about the amount of capital raised and the valuations of space companies, including those listed on stock markets through SPAC mergers.

The emergence of plans for new reusable methane-liquid oxygen launch vehicles to be ready for 2035 suggests that China is looking to make significant changes to its space transportation plans. China\u2019s government last year signaled  approval  for the continued development of a super heavy-lift launcher, known as the Long March 9. The long-planned, expendable launcher is planned to be operational by 2030, in time to facilitate Chinese megaprojects including the  International Lunar Research Station .  The giant rocket will consist of three stages and four side boosters, with the first stage and boosters using a kerosene and liquid oxygen propellant mix. However, a new concept for a fully reusable two-stage launcher has now been presented in a recent public lecture (viewable  here ) by Long Lehao, a veteran chief designer of the Long March rocket series.  The first stage of the 10.6-meter-diameter launcher would be powered by 26 clustered 200-ton-thrust methalox engines. It would be capable of carrying 150 tons of payload to Low Earth orbit, 65 tons to geosynchronous transfer orbit, or 50 tons to trans-lunar injection. Long, a senior official who frequently presented updates on China\u2019s space activities, revealed that the new launches are to be ready by 2035, and likely developed in parallel to the expendable version. The largest variant, apparently including a third stage, would have a length of 110 meters and a takeoff mass of 4,122 tons. The concepts would be a dramatic departure from both the expendable model of the Long March 9 and a version with a reusable first stage presented  last year , with fully reusability now a goal. The frequent change in concepts however also suggests China\u2019s plans are somewhat in flux. The presentation, made in July, comes shortly ahead of first orbital test flights for the expendable Space Launch System and SpaceX\u2019s fully reusable Starship. Methane-liquid oxygen offers advantages in performance and reduces issues of soot formation and coking for purposes of reusability. The plans follow the trend of SpaceX, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance in switching to the fuel. It also follows a smaller two-stage methane-liquid oxygen launcher  concept , apparently drawing on SpaceX\u2019s Starship, presented by Wang Xiaojun, president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT). The apparent switch to methalox appears sudden. China\u2019s propulsion institutes, under the state-owned conglomerate the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), have however  long been working  on methane engines, making a change of plans somewhat feasible. A smaller five-meter-diameter reusable rocket presented by Long could potentially be intended to replace a number of aging hypergolic rockets, as well as more recent kerosene-fueled Long March rockets which have become operational over the last decade. Chinese commercial launch companies Landspace and iSpace have been developing methane-liquid oxygen launchers in recent years, possibly with help of military-civil fusion national strategy which facilitates transfer of restricted technologies. Landspace is set to attempt its first launch on the methalox  Zhuque-2  in the near future from Jiuquan spaceport. Competitor iSpace is also preparing to conduct hop tests with a methalox first stage test article for its reusable Hyperbola-2 rocket at Jiuquan. While various figures have been published, the original, expendable Long March 9 is expected to be around 103 meters long, feature a 10-meter-diameter core and have a mass at liftoff of 4,140 metric tons, and be capable of lifting 140 tons to Low Earth orbit or 50 tons to trans-lunar injection.  Dual nozzle 500 ton-thrust kerosene-liquid oxygen (YF-130) engines will power the first stage and boosters,  220-ton-thrust  liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen staged combustion cycle (YF-90) engines for the second stage, with significant progress already made on both. Vacuum-optimized hydrolox engines would power the third stage.  The reusable first stage version presented in 2021 would switch to a first stage using 16 clustered 360-ton-thrust kerolox engines and no side boosters. 120-ton-thrust hydrolox engines would be used for the second and third stages. The largest variant of the Long March 9 in Long\u2019s new lecture featuring the fully reusable concepts would have a 10.6-meter-diameter, a length of 110 meters and takeoff mass of 4,122 tons, matching the capabilities of the earlier plans. A more economical, reusable version of the Long March 9 could be ready to support a proposed  space-based solar power program  in geostationary orbit. China is also developing a three-stage  heavy-lift rocket  designed to be capable of sending Chinese astronauts to the moon. A two-stage version for low Earth orbit could have its first flight in 2026.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/china-could-shift-to-fully-reusable-super-heavy-launcher-in-wake-of-starship/"}, "76": {"title": "Virgin Orbit reduces launch forecast while increasing per-launch revenue", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Virgin Orbit now expects to perform four launches this year, at the low end of earlier projections, but with a higher per-launch revenue. The company, in its second quarter earnings release Aug. 12, reported no revenue in the quarter and a net loss of $33.3 million. The company, though, said it recorded more than $12 million in revenue in  its second launch of the year July 2 , just after the end of the quarter. The company recognizes revenue at the time of launch. The $12 million is significantly higher than previous launches, which averaged $2.5 million per launch. Upcoming launches, the company projected, will produce $6 million to $12 million of revenue per launch. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a reaction of the market as we have steadily proven the technology and then gone into operations and demonstrated the reliability of the system,\u201d said Dan Hart, chief executive of Virgin Orbit. \u201cYou\u2019re also seeing that some customers have additional requirements and needs, oftentimes government payloads require some additional aspects of mission assurance or handling of their payloads.\u201d As Virgin Orbit\u2019s LauncherOne system moved from development into operations, with four consecutive successful launches dating back to early 2021, the company is making improvements in launch operations. Hart said that on the most recent launch, the company reduced manufacturing labor hours for the rocket by 25% and time in launch operations by 9%. \u201cFewer days in launch operations significantly reduces our overall launch costs and drives overhead efficiency, while increasing our launch responsiveness,\u201d Hart said, adding that the company was \u201cahead of the planned learning curve\u201d with those reductions. However, its forecast for the number of launches in the year has shrunk. The company now projects conducting just four launches this year, down from the six the company planned at the beginning of the year and  a range of four to six launches it forecast in June . The next launch remains the first Virgin Orbit launch from outside the United States, at Spaceport Cornwall in England. The company, which previously expected that launch to take place in September, did not give a date for it in its earnings call, instead calling it only its \u201cnext launch.\u201d Hart said the LauncherOne rocket for that mission will leave the company\u2019s Long Beach, California, factory in the next two weeks and go to the Mojave Air and Space Port for a launch rehearsal. He said Virgin Orbit is also working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the U.K. agency responsible for licensing launches.  The CAA announced a public consultation on the proposed launch license July 22 , scheduled to close Aug. 22. \u201cThis is the first launch that they\u2019ve ever done, and so we\u2019re working very closely with them. It\u2019s a new process and it takes a bit of time to go through it,\u201d Hart said of the company\u2019s interactions with the CAA. Other factors for the timing of the launch include the readiness of the payloads for the mission as well as required infrastructure at the launch site, a commercial airport. After the Cornwall launch, Virgin Orbit expects to perform one more launch in the fourth quarter from Mojave, the site of its previous launches. The company did not disclose the customer for that launch. Virgin Orbit ended the quarter with $122 million of cash on hand. That included raising $50 million through exercising part of a standby equity purchase agreement it announced in March with a hedge fund, Yorkville Advisors, to sell up to $250 million in equity over three years. Brita O\u2019Rear, Virgin Orbit\u2019s chief financial officer, said the cash on hand should \u201cprovide sufficient near-term liquidity\u201d for the company. \u201cWe will continue to be opportunistic in the capital markets.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/virgin-orbit-reduces-launch-forecast-while-increasing-per-launch-revenue/"}, "77": {"title": "Space Force studying requirements for cislunar space domain awareness", "content": "WAILEA, Hawaii \u2014 The Space Force expects to know by next spring what capabilities it will need to carry out space domain awareness activities in cislunar space. In a talk during the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference here Sept. 28, Col. Marc Brock, commander of Space Delta 2, the unit responsible for space domain awareness for the Space Force, said a study is underway by the 19th Space Defense Squadron (SDS) on what\u2019s needed to monitor activities beyond geostationary orbit, called xGEO by the Space Force, and out to the moon. That study, he said, will look at requirements to create an \u201coperational capability\u201d for cislunar or xGEO space domain awareness. That includes training, technologies and centers needed to carry out the mission. He said that report should be ready by next April or May. \u201cFollowing that, the timeframe to have a viable capability is dependent on the resourcing that we have as a service,\u201d he said. Some existing ground-based resources already exist to carry out that mission, he said, but said there will likely need to be new space-based systems. \u201cWe need a space-based capability to really provide the surveillance of xGEO or cislunar and so I can\u2019t give you a timeframe for when that is,\u201d he said. There are some technology demonstration efforts underway, like the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s Cislunar Highway Patrol System, or CHPS. That is a mission planned for launch in 2025 to operate in cislunar space, testing technologies to track and identify objects there. Brock referred to those efforts, but said an operational system based on something like CHPS may take considerably longer to implement. \u201cTo really have a long-term viable operational capability, it\u2019s going to take will and it\u2019s going to take resources,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t answer a specific time other than we will be postured hopefully within the next several years to utilize the resources that are available to perform that mission.\u201d The work on cislunar space domain awareness is one of the missions of the 19th SDS, which he described as an \u201cinnovation sandbox\u201d for Space Delta 2.

She said it is \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d that Commerce succeeds at establishing a civilian space traffic management office, an effort that started in 2018 when the former Trump administration issued a  policy directing  Commerce to provide spaceflight safety services for civil and commercial satellite operators, a job currently performed by U.S. Space Command\u2019s 18th Space Defense squadron. Burt said she met in July with  Richard DalBello , director of the Office of Space Commerce. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great work. And we\u2019ve been teaming with him over the last few months,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s vital for the Department of Defense that the relationship is successful.\u201d There is no time to waste getting this office stood up, given the rapid growth in commercial space activities, said Burt. \u201cEvery domain has a civil entity or government entity that works the traffic in a peacetime environment. We need to make that happen in the space domain.\u201d DoD has performed these duties by default \u201cprimarily because we had the preponderance of assets on orbit. But that is no longer the case. The commercial market is outstripping us in numbers,\u201d Burt said. Just like the U.S. Air Force scrambles jets when there\u2019s unauthorized aircraft in the air, the same concept would apply in space, she said. The routine space traffic should be managed by a civilian agency and DoD would be called up when there\u2019s something suspicious or nefarious going on.  A key part of the transition is figuring out \u201chow we communicate\u201d between Commerce and Defense, Burt said. \u201cThere absolutely has to be interchangeable data and information so that we don\u2019t have any unknowns.\u201d Burt said there are  working groups from DoD and OSC  meeting weekly to map out \u201chow we\u2019re going to go after this.\u201d The key questions that have to be answered, she said, are \u201chow are we sharing data? What are we measuring the data against ? What is truth data? What\u2019s the classification of the data? How will we protect the data? How will we maintain the catalog that\u2019s produced and published to the world ? And what are basic services?\u201d The 2018  Space Policy Directive-3  directs the Department of Commerce to provide a basic level of space situational awareness for public and private use, based on the space catalog compiled by the Department of Defense. Commerce would inform satellite operators if there is a potential for a collision with another passing satellite or piece of debris. The 18th Space Defense Squadron at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, currently provides SSA services and issues collision warnings to satellite operators around the world.

NASA announced Dec. 7 that the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) spacecraft has not communicated with ground stations since Nov. 25. The spacecraft,  launched in October 2019 , had not experienced any major issues reported by NASA before this incident. The loss of contract would have triggered an eight-day \u201ccommand loss timer\u201d on the spacecraft, causing it to reset its systems after eight days.

The agency said engineers believe the problem is with the spacecraft\u2019s avionics or communications subsystems, but have little information to support troubleshooting. \u201cThe team is currently unable to determine the health of the spacecraft, and the lack of a downlink signal could be indicative of a system failure,\u201d it stated. NASA said it has ruled out damage to the spacecraft from an explosion of debris impact, noting that observations of the low Earth orbit spacecraft by the Defense Department\u2019s Space Surveillance Network concluded that ICON is intact.

Speaking to the NASA Advisory Council\u2019s Human Exploration and Operations Committee Oc. 31, Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for Artemis Campaign Development at NASA, said the agency\u2019s understanding of progress on testing of the Starship vehicle, including its Super Heavy booster, supported an orbital launch attempt late this year. \u201cRight now, the schedule would lead to an early December test flight,\u201d he said. The profile for that test flight would be the same as the company previously detailed in regulatory filings, with the Super Heavy booster and Starship lifting off from the Boca Chica, Texas, test site. Starship would go into orbit but almost immediately reenter, splashing down near Hawaii after completing less than one orbit. That schedule is dependent on several upcoming milestones, including a static-fire test of all 33 Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster designated Booster 7. SpaceX has yet to fire all 33 Raptor engines simultaneously, having done tests of up to seven engines at a time as well as a \u201cspin prime\u201d test where the engines\u2019 turbopumps are turned on and propellant flowed through the engines without igniting them. It was during a spin prime test July 11 that SpaceX suffered what NASA euphemistically calls a \u201chigh-energy event\u201d when propellants ignited underneath the booster, damaging it. SpaceX has repaired the booster and implemented corrective actions, according to the agency. Kirasich said that test put \u201ca relatively large amount of fuel\u201d into a cloud of oxygen, triggering the detonation. \u201cThat was an operational and planning oversight. SpaceX, in the early days, goes for speed above systems engineering rigor,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cpause and learn\u201d event for SpaceX. \u201cThey\u2019ve since elevated the level of systems engineering put into each one of these tests, as well as brought in some new leadership into the team down there,\u201d he said, resulting in \u201cadditional rigor\u201d in subsequent tests. That incident also attracted the attention of NASA\u2019s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. A member of the panel, Paul Hill, mentioned it at the panel\u2019s Oct. 27 public meeting. \u201cSpaceX is still pursuing an aggressive Starship development test plan, but this failure resulted in corrective actions to increase systems engineering and risk management rigor,\u201d he said. Kirasich said there are still several milestones before Starship will be ready for an orbital launch. That includes the static-fire test of all 33 Raptor engines in Super Heavy as well as a full wet dress rehearsal where the Starship and Super Heavy vehicles are loaded with propellants and go through a practice countdown. SpaceX also requires a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration for the mission. While  the FAA cleared the way for Starship launches from Boca Chica with an environmental review in June,  that review required SpaceX to implement more than 75 measures to mitigate the environmental effects of those launches. That licensing \u201cis still ahead of us,\u201d Kirasich said. NASA is closely following preparations for the first Starship orbital launch because the agency sees it as the first in a series of tests of a vehicle the agency plans to use to land astronauts on the moon on Artemis 3 through its Human Landing System contract with SpaceX. \u201cWe track four major Starship flights,\u201d Kirasich said, starting with the first orbital launch.

The Koreasat 6A spacecraft will have 20 transponders for fixed satellite services and six for TV broadcasting to replace Koreasat 6, which launched to geostationary orbit (GEO) at 116 degrees East in December 2010. Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy built Koreasat 6 and has a long history of providing satellites for South Korea. In addition to delivering three other communications satellites \u2014 Koreasat 5, 5A, and 7 \u2014 Thales Alenia Space has helped provide Earth observation, navigation, and meteorological spacecraft for the country.  The company is also supporting South Korea\u2019s lunar exploration program, which  is on track  to send a robotic spacecraft to lunar orbit in December. KT SAT CEO David Kyungmin Song said it picked Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for Koreasat 6A after running a competitive process with multiple bidders. Koreasat 6A will be based on the manufacturer\u2019s Spacebus 4000B2 platform and is expected to weigh about 3.5 metric tons at launch. The manufacturer said it will be designed to operate for at least 15 years. Thales Alenia Space is also training and supporting KT Sat\u2019s on-site engineering team as part of its contract, and will provide operational assistance throughout the satellite\u2019s operational lifetime. While Koreasat 6A\u2019s services will be focused on South Korea, KT SAT has coverage over other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa with its fleet of four fully owned satellites built by  Thales Alenia Space, and capacity the operator leases from a satellite manufactured by what is now Maxar Technologies. Thales Alenia Space said it had signed a launch contract for Koreasat 6A that it expects to announce shortly. GEO rebound Speaking to  SpaceNews  on the sidelines of World Satellite Business Week here, Thales Alenia Space CEO Herv\u00e9 Derrey said the company has secured orders for eight GEO satcoms satellites in the last 10 months. Most of these are based on Thales Alenia Space\u2019s Space Inspire platform, part of a new breed of software-defined satellites that can be reprogrammed in orbit to respond to changing data demands. However, Koreasat 6A,  ASTRA 1P for SES , and  HTS 113BT for Indonesia\u2019s Telkomsat  are classic GEO satellites without a software-defined payload, which Derrey said promises better economics for operators with more stable demand forecasts that are also looking to deploy their spacecraft faster. Despite Koreasat 6A\u2019s speedy two-year delivery schedule, Derrey is confident Thales Alenia Space can avoid getting caught up in supply chain issues that have slowed down other satellite projects across the industry.  \u201cIt\u2019s a product that is fully developed \u2014 for which we also have some stock in terms of components,\u201d he said. Still, Derrey expects software-defined satellites will cover \u201cat least 60% of the GEO market\u201d in the coming years. These flexible satellites are helping to drive a \u201crebound in the GEO [satcoms] market,\u201d he added, which appears on track to average \u201cbetween 12 and 15\u201d orders a year. Although that is still short of the 20 GEO orders the industry was pulling in annually seven years ago, it is a significant improvement on the fewer than 10 orders a year the market has seen recently. Derrey attributed part of the GEO slump to uncertainty in the market from incoming constellations in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO). \u201cThere was a kind of belief at that time that [NGSO] would totally replace GEO,\u201d he said. However, operators increasingly see GEO and NGSO capabilities as complementary, Derrey added, pointing to the synergies Eutelsat and OneWeb aim to achieve  by combining their networks .

These countries are developing anti-satellite weapons that are expected to  target U.S. systems  in a future conflict. In response, the United States is working to deploy  proliferated networks of satellites  that would be harder to disrupt and cheaper to build than traditional military satellites.  The U.S. today has a \u201cmagnificent architecture that the Department has built over decades for missile warning, missile tracking, precision navigation and timing, satellite communications and space domain awareness,\u201d Calvelli said.  \u201cThese are fantastic systems\u201d but most of these satellites are very large, he added, and \u201cwe put a lot of stuff in geosynchronous orbit.

It\u2019s really important that we drive our architecture to have some resiliency, and that\u2019s going to be through diversification, diversification of orbits and proliferation of satellites,\u201d said Calvelli. He said he wrote the nine tenets because \u201cI really, really want to go faster.\u201d The \u201cold way of doing business\u201d was to spend a decade developing large satellites. \u201cWe need to change that paradigm and do things much faster.\u201d Message to industry Calvelli also wanted these tenets to serve as \u201cmy messaging to the industry\u201d that the traditional contracts where the government bears the risks and pays for cost overruns will no longer be acceptable.

At an Oct. 11 briefing, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced that the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft,  which collided with the asteroid Dimorphos Sept. 26 , changed the asteroid\u2019s orbit around a larger asteroid, Didymos, by 32 minutes. Dimorphos, which previously took 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit Didymos, now completes an orbit in 11 hours and 23 minutes, based on ground-based optical and radar observations. \u201cThis is a watershed moment for planetary defense and a watershed moment for humanity,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cThis mission shows that NASA is trying to be ready for whatever the universe throws at us.\u201d DART collided with Dimorphos as a test of the \u201ckinetic impactor\u201d technique that could be used to deflect an asteroid on a trajectory to impact the Earth. The mission had a requirement to change the orbit by at least 73 seconds, and models from before the impact predicted a change of between a few minutes and several tens of minutes, said Lori Glaze, director of NASA\u2019s planetary science division. The revised orbit, with a precision of plus or minus two minutes, is consistent with those models, \u201cbut clearly at the upper end of that range.\u201d The revised orbit came from observations from four telescopes in Chile and South Africa that monitored the lightcurve, or change in brightness over time, of the combined Didymos-Dimorphos system. Those data, analyzed by two groups in different ways, reached the same measurement of the new orbital period, said Nancy Chabot, DART coordination lead at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Radar observations from observatories in California and West Virginia also measured the same orbital period. \u201cThis is a very exciting and promising result for planetary defense,\u201d Chabot said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely indicating that you\u2019re getting an enhanced deflection due to the amount of ejecta, that rocky material being thrown off when DART\u2019s collision happened.\u201d That ejecta may be linked to Dimorphos being a \u201crubble pile\u201d asteroid, a collection of smaller rocks rather than a single intact body. \u201cWe expect a solid rock to be less responsive than a pile of gravel,\u201d said Tom Statler, DART program scientist at NASA Headquarters. \u201cWhen I saw Dimorphos come into view and when I saw there was not a single crater on it, and there were a lot of what appeared to be loose rocks,\u201d he said, recalling some of the last images returned by DART before its impact, \u201cI looked at it and I said, \u2018This is not going to be 73 seconds.\u2019\u201d Scientists are still working to measure the overall effectiveness of the impact, a value known as beta; a higher value means a greater change in momentum of the asteroid. \u201cIt seems virtually certain that the ejecta were a significant contributor to the period change, so we know beta is not equal to one, because that would have been no ejecta,\u201d Statler said. Observations of Didymos and Dimorphos will continue for months, including those from large ground- and space-based telescopes that show a tail of debris extending for 10,000 kilometers from Dimorphos. An Italian cubesat called LICIACube, deployed from DART in the weeks before the impact, flew by the asteroid minutes afterwards and took 720 images that show details of the ejecta plume not visible from Earth. The test provides optimism for NASA that a similar spacecraft could deflect a hazardous asteroid. \u201cDimorphos is a size of asteroid that is a priority for planetary defense,\u201d said Chabot. The object is 160 meters across, large enough to cause damage on a regional scale if it hit the Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been to an object that size and see how it reacts.\u201d Statler cautioned not to generalize the success of this test for all asteroids. \u201cThis is one test done on one asteroid. What we\u2019re learning every time we send a mission to another asteroid is that each asteroid has a different part of the story of our solar system\u2019s past to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be too eager to say that one test on one asteroid tells us how every other asteroid would behave in a similar situation.\u201d NASA has no plans to conduct additional impact tests like DART. Glaze said NASA\u2019s priority now for planetary defense is the Near Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor mission, a space telescope to discover more such asteroids. However, NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2023 budget request slashed funding for the mission and pushed out a planned 2026 launch to 2028. NASA is also considering a recommendation by the planetary science decadal survey in April to follow up NEO Surveyor with a \u201crapid response\u201d mission to study an asteroid on short notice as practice if a threatening asteroid was discovered. \u201cWe are capable of deflecting an asteroid\u201d of the size of Dimorphos, Glaze said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredibly successful demonstration of the kinetic impactor.

WASHINGTON \u2014 NASA came within 20 seconds of completing a full countdown rehearsal of its Space Launch System rocket June 20, although it was not immediately clear if the agency got enough data from the test to be able to proceed with a launch. After five hours of delays caused by various technical issues, the countdown for the fourth wet dress rehearsal (WDR) of the SLS at Launch Complex 39B made it to T-29 seconds, several seconds beyond the point where control was transferred from ground to flight computers, before the computer saw a \u201cflag\u201d and stopped the countdown at about 7:37 p.m. Eastern. NASA originally hoped to get the countdown to a manual cutoff point of T-9.3 seconds, just before, on an actual launch, the vehicle would ignite the four RS-25 engines in its core stage. However, NASA TV commentary stated that they expected to see a flag at the 29-second point in the countdown. That terminal count took place about five hours later than planned because of technical issues, including a liquid hydrogen leak in a \u201cquick disconnect\u201d fitting for a bleed line that transfers that propellant from the core stage back to the pad. Efforts to stop the leak, including warming then cooling the fitting in the hopes of resealing the connection, failed. After lengthy deliberation, NASA managers elected to proceed with the terminal countdown from a preplanned T-10 minute hold after taking steps to mask, or hide, the warnings about the leak from computers. \u201cWe were always protected in the flight software so we knew that we had protections there,\u201d launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson said on NASA TV shortly after the end of the test, when asked about the decision to proceed with the countdown despite the leak. Launch personnel were monitoring the vehicle closely. \u201cI felt like we were in a really good configuration to continue to get into terminal count and see how the hardware performed.\u201d The hydrogen leak, which was not related to the leak seen in a previous WDR in April, was the most serious but not the only issue that came up during this test. NASA delayed the start of tanking of the core stage by about two hours because of a problem with a valve in a backup gaseous nitrogen line serving the pad. Later, loading of liquid oxygen into the SLS upper stage was halted for a time after hitting a pressure limit. There was also a small grass fire near a flare stack in the vicinity of the pad used to burn off excess hydrogen. Those problems and the delays they caused led to changes in the countdown rehearsal, scrapping a plan to stop the countdown at T-33 seconds, recycling, then going again to T-9.3 seconds. However, this WDR got far closer to completion than three previous attempts in April, and marked the first time the vehicle was completely filled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellant at the pad. \u201cThat was a big milestone for us,\u201d Blackwell-Thompson said of fueling the vehicle. \u201cDefinitely a good day for us and a very exciting day as well.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the day was good enough to meet all of NASA\u2019s requirements for the WDR and allow the vehicle to go back to the Vehicle Assembly Building to prepare for a launch that could take place as soon as late August. She declined to speculate on what this test meant for launch plans, saying the launch team was focused on reviewing the data. At a June 15 briefing, Jim Free, NASA associate administrator for exploration systems development, was asked what NASA would do in a scenario like this, where it could perform only one of the two planned terminal countdowns. \u201cWe need to understand everything we can before we commit to launch,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first caution is to say we\u2019re going to understand what every situation is and run it to ground before we would press to commit to launch.\u201d \u201cTo me, it would depend on what the scenario was,\u201d Blackwell-Thompson said at that earlier briefing, noting the agency would evaluate the data and any \u201cresidual risk\u201d from not completing the full WDR. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to speculate without the specifics.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-nearly-completes-sls-countdown-test/"}, "88": {"title": "China to target near-Earth object 2020 PN1 for asteroid deflection mission", "content": "HELSINKI \u2014 China has set its sights on near-Earth object 202 PN1 as the target for a combined asteroid deflection and observation test mission due to launch in 2026. The new details of the near-Earth asteroid defense system demonstration and verification test mission were presented by Long Lehao, chief designer of China\u2019s Long March rocket series, in a recent \u201cScience and Innovation China\u201d series lecture ( video  in Chinese). A slide presented by Long indicates that the impactor mission will launch in 2026 on a Long March 3B rocket. The mission will include a separate impactor and orbiter. The former will impact near-Earth object 2020 PN1 with the latter spacecraft making observations. If correct, the mission appears to combine elements of the separate NASA  DART  mission, due to collide with Dimorphos, a moon orbiting the near Earth asteroid Didymos, in September, and the European Space Agency\u2019s Hera mission, which will observe Didymos and Dimorphos later this decade to determine the effects of the DART collision. Combined, the DART and Hera missions are known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment ( AIDA ) collaboration. The target for China\u2019s test,  2020 PN1 , is an Earth-crossing asteroid and a temporary co-orbital companion to the Earth. It was discovered in 2020 and estimates of its size put it at around 40 meters in diameter. The Long March 3B launcher is a workhorse for missions to geostationary orbit but has also launched lunar robotic lander missions. China earlier announced  plans  in April to attempt to alter the orbit of a potentially threatening asteroid with a kinetic impactor test as part of plans for an entire planetary defense system. Long\u2019s lecture however provides the first details regarding the mission target and profile, which differentiate it from earlier proposals.  Chinese researchers had previously published papers on concepts for kinetic impactors, namely the  \u201c Assembled Kinetic Impactor \u201d (AKI) using a Long March 5, and the more complex \u201c Enhanced Asteroid Deflector ,\u201d which would first collect rocks from a near-Earth asteroid before impacting a potentially hazardous asteroid.   The China National Space Administration (CNSA) also stated in April that it will establish an early warning system and develop software to simulate operations against the near Earth objects and test and verify basic procedures. Long\u2019s lecture also touched on exploration missions, including  Tianwen-2 , a near-Earth asteroid sample-return mission, the  Tianwen-3  Mars sample-return, and a Jupiter system mission.  It also reiterated plans for a  two-launch mission  to put a pair of Chinese astronauts on the moon by 2030, a new  methane-liquid oxygen  heavy-lift rocket and reusable launchers, and future propulsion concepts including nuclear propulsion and a  spaceplane .", "url": "https://spacenews.com/china-to-target-near-earth-object-2020-pn1-for-asteroid-deflection-mission/"}, "89": {"title": "Space Force to award up to $50 million in contracts for Space Test Program experiments", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Space Force is changing its approach to buying satellites for the Space Test Program, which for decades has launched experiments for the U.S. government and allies.

The  13 locations released by NASA  Aug. 19 reach include multiple sites that could host landings by SpaceX\u2019s Starship vehicle serving as the lunar lander for the Artemis 3 mission that will carry the first NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon since Apollo 17 a half-century ago. NASA and SpaceX officials working on Artemis \u201chave worked very closely with our agency\u2019s scientists and technologists to identify these 13 regions,\u201d said Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for the Artemis Campaign Development Division at NASA, during a call with reporters about the landing sites. All the regions are of interest to scientists, he said, \u201cas well as meet the Artemis mission planning constraints, which can be challenging.\u201d  The 13 locations, each about 15 by 15 kilometers, are located within six degrees of latitude of the south pole. They are named: Each location contains multiple landing sites, regions 100 meters across that would be landing zones for Starships. Jacob Bleacher, chief exploration scientist at NASA Headquarters, said each region has at least 10 landing sites \u201cand in many of them there are more than that.\u201d Different regions may be selected based on when the mission takes place because of changing lighting conditions. \u201cSpecific landing sites are tightly coupled to the timing of the launch window, so multiple regions ensure flexibility to launch throughout the year,\u201d the agency noted in a statement. The regions meet several requirements, including providing continuous access to sunlight for six and a half days, the duration of the Artemis 3 landing, while being close enough to permanently shadowed regions that they can be reached on moonwalks by the astronauts. Those permanently shadowed regions may harbor ice deposits that both are of scientific interest and could be resources for future crewed missions. Kirasich said he hopes to narrow down the list of landing sites about 18 months before Artemis 3, currently scheduled to launch in late 2025, to give mission planners time to prepare procedures specific to each site. Because of lighting variations that change over time, there will be several even for a single launch period. \u201cExactly how many we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot to learn between now and then.\u201d  NASA said it will consult with the broader science and engineering community about the selected regions to get insights on the regions. That is expected to include the annual meeting of NASA\u2019s Lunar Exploration Analysis Group Aug. 23-25 in Maryland. The agency said it will continue working with SpaceX to ensure those sites are still compatible with the lunar lander version of Starship. Bleacher said the selection process won\u2019t depend on data from future missions, including orbiters, landers and rovers. \u201cThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter did a great job,\u201d he said, a spacecraft originally developed for the Constellation lunar exploration program in the late 2000s and remains in service providing high-resolution images, although its orbit no longer takes it over the polar regions.

Rep. Park Wan-joo revealed this Sept. 28 based on information he had secured from the ministry that manages South Korea\u2019s space programs. According to the lawmaker, the ministry seeks 37.4 billion won ($26.1 million) for KOMPSAT-6 and 9.82 billion won ($6.86 million) for CAS500-2. \u201cUnder consideration are launch companies in the U.S. and EU,\u201d the ministry said in a document sent to the lawmaker, \u201cOnce the requested budget is endorsed by the congress, we will revoke the existing contracts with Russia, and then sign a new contract with a launch service provider in a manner that we have done so far.\u201d While the ministry didn\u2019t specify launch companies it wants to talk with,  reports  indicate that the ministry would choose one between SpaceX and Arianespace.

LOGAN, Utah \u2014 Northrop Grumman and Firefly Aerospace announced Aug. 8 that they will work together to develop a new first stage for Northrop\u2019s Antares launch vehicle as well as a future medium-lift rocket. The new version of the Antares, called the Antares 330, will feature a first stage using seven Miranda engines under development by Firefly. The stage will also use Firefly composites for its structure and tanks. The Antares 330 upper stage will be similar to what Northrop is currently using on the Antares, with the company\u2019s Castor 30XL solid-fuel motor and existing avionics and structures. The vehicle is designed to launch from the current pad at Virginia\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport that has hosted all previous Antares launches. \u201cThrough our collaboration, we will first develop a fully domestic version of our Antares rocket, the Antares 330, for Cygnus space station commercial resupply services,\u201d Scott Lehr, vice president and general manager of launch missile defense systems at Northrop, said in a statement. The partnership would solve Northrop\u2019s current reliance on Ukrainian and Russian suppliers for the Antares first stage that put the future of the vehicle, used for launching Cygnus cargo missions to the International Space Station, in doubt. Ukraine\u2019s Yuzhnoye State Design Office and Yuzhmash Machine Building plant produces the Antares first stage, which is powered by RD-181 engines from Russia\u2019s NPO Energomash. The supply of both the engines and the first stage has been in doubt since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February. Northrop officials noted they have completed first stages for two more Antares launches, the first of which is scheduled for October, and that the company was working on options should either the stage or the engines become unavailable. Those executives, though, had declined to go into details about those backup plans before the Firefly partnership announcement. The two companies provided few other details about their partnership, including financial aspects. Kurt Eberly, director of space launch programs at Northrop Grumman, told SpaceNews that the company expects the Antares 330 to be ready as soon as 2024. To cover the gap between the last launch of the current Antares and the new version, Northrop is buying three SpaceX Falcon 9 launches for its Cygnus spacecraft. The companies said the Antares 330 will \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the vehicle\u2019s payload capacity compared to the existing Antares. Eberly said the Antares 330 will be able to place up to 10,500 kilograms into the insertion orbit sued for ISS missions, compared to 8,100 kilograms for the current Antares. He said that performance would translate into an additional 1,250 kilograms of cargo that Cygnus could deliver to the ISS, to 5,000 kilograms. The companies also said the partnership would lead to the development of a separate \u201centirely new\u201d medium-lift launch vehicle, details of which the companies did not disclose. Firefly is working on its own medium-lift vehicle, called Beta, whose first stage will also incorporate the Miranda engine. That engine, which uses liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, is designed to produce about 230,000 pounds-force of thrust. Eberly said that new vehicle is projected to make its first launch as soon as 2025. \u201cFirefly prides itself on being a disrupter in the new space industry and collaborating with a proven space pioneer like Northrop Grumman will help us continue that disruption,\u201d said Peter Schumacher, interim chief executive of Firefly, in the statement.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-and-firefly-to-partner-on-upgraded-antares/"}, "95": {"title": "Space Force opens door to Blue Origin with new cooperative agreement", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Space Systems Command announced Nov. 18 it signed an agreement with Blue Origin that \u201cpaves the way\u201d for the company\u2019s New Glenn rocket to compete for national security launch contracts once it completes the required flight certification.  The cooperative research and development (CRADA) agreement does not include any government funding and is largely symbolic, as New Glenn is still in development and Blue Origin has  no target date  for the first launch.

NOAA is  investing in a new generation  of Earth-observing satellites as well as ground and IT systems to transfer data  into the cloud. Ground-station-as-a-service and cloud-services providers are expected to play an important role in helping NOAA process, disseminate and store data. In April, NOAA  sought information  from contractors interested in providing engineering and information-technology services, and handling flight operations for polar-orbiting satellites NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19. The NOAA-18 demonstration could inform that effort and also prompt other government agencies to turn to commercial clouds for primary or backup satellite services. \u201cI would envision the future is a hybrid architecture where the government has unique government applications and missions, but they are also leveraging commercial technologies and integrating those technologies into the missions that they are performing,\u201d Kitay said. When Microsoft and NOAA signed the cooperative research and development agreement last year, their partner was Kubos. In April,  Xplore acquired Kubos  and its Major Tom software. \u201cBy our continued support of the Major Tom team, we were able to continue that work,\u201d said Lisa Rich, Xplore founder and chief operating officer.", "url": "https://spacenews.com/noaa-microsoft-xplore-noaa-18/"}, "99": {"title": "Entire NASA astronaut corps eligible for Artemis missions", "content": "HOUSTON \u2014 As NASA prepares to select the crew of the second Artemis mission, the agency\u2019s chief astronaut says the entire astronaut corps, and not a previously announced subset, is eligible for that flight and future missions to the moon. At an Aug. 5 briefing at the Johnson Space Center about the upcoming uncrewed Artemis 1 mission, Reid Weisman, the chief of the astronaut office, said he expected the four-person crew who will fly on Artemis 2 to be selected soon. \u201cThe question everyone will ask is when are we assigning a crew to Artemis 2? We hope that will be later this year,\u201d he said. That mission is expected to launch no earlier than 2024. Artemis 2 will be the first crewed flight of Orion, going around the moon on a flight lasting about 10 days. The four-person crew  will include one Canadian astronaut as part of a December 2020 agreement between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency  regarding Canada\u2019s contribution of the Canadarm3 robotic arm for the lunar Gateway. NASA has not stated if any other international partners, such as Europe or Japan, will fly astronauts on Artemis 2. As for the agency\u2019s own astronauts, Wiseman said the entire 42-person astronaut corps will be considered for that mission and later Artemis flights. \u201cThe way I look at it, any one of our 42 active astronauts is eligible for an Artemis mission,\u201d he said, a point he emphasized several times during the briefing. \u201cWe want to assemble the right team for this mission.\u201d That is a change from late 2020,  when NASA unveiled an \u201cArtemis Team\u201d of 18 astronauts  that agency leadership at the time, along with then-Vice President Mike Pence, said would form a pool from which NASA would select crews for at least initial Artemis missions. \u201cMy fellow Americans, I give you the heroes of the future who will carry us back to the moon and beyond, the Artemis generation,\u201d Pence said at a December 2020 National Space Council meeting where he announced the 18 astronauts who would comprise the team. Five of the 18 attended that meeting at the Kennedy Space Center. Jim Bridenstine, NASA administrator at the time, said more astronauts would be added in the future, including those from international partners. \u201cThis is our first cadre of our Artemis astronauts,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cI want to be clear: there\u2019s going to be more.\u201d Wiseman, though, emphasized that he would consider all current astronauts, as well as 10 astronaut candidates currently in training. \u201cWe have 42 active astronauts here in Houston and 10 astronaut candidates who will be beating down the door for Artemis 2 and beyond,\u201d he said. He added that NASA has also changed lifetime radiation exposure requirements, which previously varied by age and gender, to a single limit.  A June 2021 report by the National Academies endorsed such a proposal , noting it \u201ccreates equality of opportunity for spaceflight\u201d over the previous standards that set lower limits for women. Wiseman said those earlier \u201cdraconian\u201d standards had been replaced by a single limit. \u201cWe have equalized all radiation limits. It does not matter whether you\u2019re a man, whether you\u2019re a woman, it is the exact same.\u201d \u201cOur end goal is, the United States of America is half men, half women. Well, space should be at least that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we cannot make these spacecraft equitable, and we can\u2019t fly any type of person on them, then we need to look at our systems and reevaluate.\u201d There are also no age restrictions on Artemis mission assignments, he said, noting the astronaut corps includes people with ages ranging from the late 20s to the mid-60s. \u201cAs long as you are healthy, we\u2019re going to load you on a rocket and shoot you off the planet.\u201d", "url": "https://spacenews.com/entire-nasa-astronaut-corps-eligible-for-artemis-missions/"}}
